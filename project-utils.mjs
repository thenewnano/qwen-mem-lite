 *
 * Deliberately does NOT anchor on the git work-tree root. That was tried and reverted
 * before it shipped: it fixes `cd src/auth && qwen-mem-lite recent` (session rooted at
 * the repo root, CLI run deeper) but BREAKS the mirror case, which is more common —
 * CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is the directory Claude Code was started in, not the repo root, so
 * `cd packages/api && claude` makes hooks write `packages--api` while a plain terminal in
 * the same directory would walk to the work-tree root and read `mono--monorepo`.
 * Reproduced pre-tag: hooks saved to `packages--api`, `recent` answered
 * `No recent observations (h1--mono)`. Splitting a monorepo user's namespace silently is
 * worse than the subdirectory case, and unlike it, cwd-derivation at least keeps the hook
 * and CLI faces agreeing whenever the session root and cwd match. A correct fix has to
 * consult the DB for which candidate actually holds rows; this module is DB-free and on
 * the hook hot path, so it is not the place. Tracked as deferred work.
