 * Find observations eligible for LLM re-enrichment.

 * Two scopes:
 * - 'narrow' (default): fully-degraded observations — Haiku failed to extract
 *   concepts / facts / lesson / aliases. Conservative; preserves pre-R-7 behavior.
 * - 'wide' (R-7): substantive bugfix / refactor / feature / decision observations
 *   that have concepts + facts populated but are missing lesson_learned.
 *   Targets the "Haiku ran but judged 'none'" cases that dominate the library.
 *   Excludes LOW_SIGNAL titles (no source material to extract from) and
 *   thin narratives (<100 chars → nothing to rewrite into a lesson).
 *
 * Both scopes respect optimized_at (idempotent) and skip compressed/superseded rows.
 *
 * @param {object} db better-sqlite3 database handle
 * @param {number} limit max candidates to return
 * @param {{ scope?: 'narrow' | 'wide' | 'aliases' | 'scopes' | 'concepts', project?: string }} [opts] Optional project filter (e.g. inferProject()-resolved name) narrows candidates to a single project — opt-in to preserve prior cross-project default.

    -- carries an eighth ordering, "ORDER BY project, created_at_epoch" -- ASCENDING, no id
    -- term, no LIMIT. It is outside the seven by construction and is left alone under Iron
    -- Law #1: it feeds clusterForCompression, and a tie can move cluster MEMBERSHIP
    -- because that function's own sort is stable, so SQL order survives as the tiebreak

    -- vector branch this used to hide behind, so the hazard is no longer gated on a

 * The layer-1 shape gate. Two classes plus a strip, and every part of it is here because a
 * hand-drawn version of it rejected something real.
 *
 * PUNCT — what a JSON group literal needs. Applied to the raw token AND to its NFKC fold, so
 * a fullwidth lookalike (U+FF5B, U+FF02, U+FF3B) is judged as the character it imitates. The
 * fold is judged against THIS class only: adding the invisible classes to the folded form
 * rejected `caf\u00B4e`, because the keyboard spacing acute folds to space + combining accent
 * and space is `\p{Zs}` — the docblock example failing its own gate.
 *
 * INVISIBLE — `\p{Default_Ignorable_Code_Point}` is Unicode's own name for "present in the
 * text, absent from the rendering", which is exactly the property that lets a phrase read to
 * a tokenizer as one word while JS `\\s` (a FIXED LIST, not "whitespace") leaves it as one
 * token for the caller. Plus the surrogate/private-use/separator categories, plus U+2800
 * BRAILLE PATTERN BLANK — a real graphic character that happens to render blank, so Unicode
 * correctly does not call it ignorable and we have to name it.
 *
 * THREE hand-drawn versions of this class each rejected real text, which is why it is now
 * stated as a property rather than a list:
 *   1. `[\u0000-\u001F]` stopped at U+001F, so U+0085 NEL and the C1 block walked through.
 *   2. `\p{Cf}` swept up U+200C ZWNJ and U+200D ZWJ — REQUIRED orthography in Persian and
 *      Hindi. They are stripped via `\p{Join_Control}` (which is exactly those two) before the
 *      test. The cost: a phrase joined with them survives as one token, bounded by the
 *      per-project fan-out to the attacker's own project.
 *   3. `\p{Cf}` ALSO swept up U+0600, U+0601, U+06DD, U+070F and U+08E2 — Arabic and Syriac
 *      format characters that are real orthography and are NOT default-ignorable. Neither
 *      review caught that one; it turned up by asking what `\p{Cf}` actually contains instead
 *      of trusting the class name.
 *
 * `\p{Cn}` is deliberately absent. Both classes are bound to the runtime's Unicode version,
 * so stability is not the discriminator — DIRECTION is. An older runtime calls a
 * newly-assigned character unassigned, so `\p{Cn}` would REJECT real orthography, unbounded
 * and on the user's own text; an older runtime simply has not heard of a newly-added
 * default-ignorable, so this class ACCEPTS one it should not — bounded by the per-project
 * fan-out to the attacker's own project, and by layer 3. Fail-open on the class Unicode is
 * still growing beats fail-closed on the class it has already assigned.

/**
 * The slice of projects this run handles, ROTATING so the surplus is deferred rather than
 * starved (second review, P2-1).
 *
 * The first version took `projects.slice(0, MAX)` off a deterministic `n DESC, project ASC`
 * ordering with nothing advancing between runs — so past the cap the same projects were
 * picked every run forever and the rest were never normalized at all, while the CHANGELOG
 * told users "each project is still normalized". Reproduced across two runs on one DB:
 * byte-identical picked set.
 *
 * The cursor is the last project handled; the next run starts after it and wraps. A cursor
 * naming a project that has since disappeared yields index -1, so the run restarts at the
 * head — the same place a first-ever run starts, which is the behaviour we want anyway.
 *
 * BOUND, measured by third review and stated rather than implied: "deferred, not starved"
 * holds under a STABLE ordering. The primary sort key is row count, so a project that keeps
 * gaining observations can keep jumping ahead of the cursor; driven adversarially, one project
 * was held out for 200 runs. That needs the attacker to know the cursor and to churn row
 * counts deliberately; under realistic churn every project is covered in ceil(n/8) runs, which
 * the same review verified for n = 9, 10, 16, 17 and 25. The failure mode is a delay, not a
 * loss, and the row it delays is one nothing else reads.
 *
 * Exported because it is the only part of the rotation that can be tested DETERMINISTICALLY.
 * `NORMALIZE_GATE_FILE` is one file shared by every project and every concurrent run — the
 * 7-day timer always had that property and the cursor inherits it — so an end-to-end
 * "run twice and compare the picks" case is at the mercy of whatever else touched the file
 * in between. Under vitest's parallel workers that is not hypothetical: such a case passed
 * alone and failed in the suite. A pure function tested directly says the same thing without
 * being a coin flip.

 * — so the model had no way to refuse. The sibling executeMergeCluster has had

 * the model may say no, and this is the one that HIDES its inputs (compressed_into removes
 * them from every injection and search surface and puts them out of recoverBuriedLessons'
 * reach).
 *
 * It matters because there is no upstream relatedness check at all any more.
 * clusterForCompression used to compute cosine similarity when a TF-IDF vocabulary was

 * so the 14-day-window-ALONE branch was already what shipped, and Phase-2's removal of the
 * arm made it the only branch. Measured with a control arm 2026-09-07, before the removal:

 * on. This veto is therefore the ONLY thing standing between the heuristic and an

            //     cadence that the main scope exists to provide.
            //   • It is a fundamentally cheaper call: one enum token (maxTokens 60)

            //     mis-prices it by an order of magnitude.
