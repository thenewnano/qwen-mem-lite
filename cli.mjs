// D#26 / R12 P1-1, second half. `doctor` and `repair` exist to tell a user which
// file their install is missing. Until now, on exactly that install, they did not
// run: install.mjs's ~13 static imports resolve BEFORE its first line executes, so
// one absent module killed the command with a bare ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND and zero
// bytes of stdout. A half-finished update, a trimmed tarball (this repo has
// shipped three) or a hand-deleted file all land there — CLAUDE.md's "a recovery
// path must not import the thing it recovers", on the startup edge.
//
// A static import cannot be caught inside the module that declares it, so the
// catch lives one entry up. THIS file is the host because it is the published
// `bin` and because its own static closure is one file — itself; every route
// below is an `await import()`. Whatever this prints must therefore rely on
// nothing but the language, the same charter scripts/hook-launcher.mjs follows:
// no local import may appear here, or the fallback shares the fate it reports on.
//
// The remedy is deliberately NOT `install.mjs repair` — that is the file that
// would not load. It has to come from outside the broken tree.
// THREE shapes, not one. The first cut caught only ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND, and pre-ship
// review pointed out that an interrupted write leaves a file PRESENT and truncated far
// more often than it leaves it absent: that arrives as a SyntaxError, and a truncated
// install.mjs arrives as neither — the module loads and simply has no `main`, which
// died at the call site with "main is not a function". All three are the same fact
// about the world (this install's files are not intact) and get the same answer.
// Anything else is rethrown: this is a classifier, not a swallow.

// A reader that leaves is not an error. `claude-mem-lite search x | head -1`,

// UNHANDLED error event — a ~20-line stack ending in `outVerbatim` where the user
// expected the shell prompt.
//
// WHICH COMMANDS, measured rather than generalised (20 trials each, `| head -1`,
// pre-fix): `search`, `export`, `recent`, `stats`, `doctor`, `timeline`,
// `citation-stats` 20/20; `browse` 19/20; `help`, `status`, `context`, `get`,
// `memdir-audit` 0/20. So NOT "every stdout-bearing command" — what decides it is
// whether a write is still pending when the reader goes, which depends on how many
// lines the consumer takes and how the output is batched — NOT on the 64 KB pipe
// buffer, which an earlier draft of this comment blamed: pre-ship review found
// `stats` crashing at `head -20` on an output far under it. That output's size is
// corpus dependent, so no byte count is quoted here. This is also why the crash
// survived so long — it is invisible to exactly the pipe depths a smoke test picks.
//
// Lives HERE, at the published `bin`, and not at `cli/common.mjs`'s `out()`: the
// crash reproduces on `doctor` too, whose writes are `console.log` inside
// install.mjs, so a chokepoint fix would cover the CLI half and leave the installer
// half loud. One process-level listener covers both routes below.
//
// SWALLOW, DO NOT EXIT. The first cut called `process.exit(0)` here, on the
// reasoning that a CLI whose consumer has gone should stop rather than serialise a
// whole-DB `export` into a dead pipe. Pre-ship review measured what that costs:
// `doctor | head -1` under `pipefail` exited 0 on 10/10 runs while the same doctor
// exits 1 unpiped, because `runDoctor` assigns `process.exitCode = 1` AFTER its last
// print (install.mjs, "Diagnostic-tool exit-code contract") and the forced exit lands
// first. That silently turns a failing `claude-mem-lite doctor || alert` — the
// wrapper that contract names — into a passing one. `process.exitCode ?? 0` does not
// rescue it: the verdict does not exist yet at kill time. Returning instead reads
// exit 1 on 10/10 and keeps the crash fixed (doctor 0/10, search 0/10 EPIPE stacks).
// Correctness over the saved work: the process finishes into a pipe nobody reads,
// which is wasted effort but never a wrong answer. Non-EPIPE is rethrown — this is a
// classifier, not a blanket swallow, the same charter `explainBrokenInstall` follows.
