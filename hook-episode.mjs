/** Rule 4's threshold — 8+ Read/Grep entries read as investigation. */

/**
 * The significance decision WITH its reasoning, for instrumentation.
 * `episodeHasSignificantContent` is the boolean face of this same body, so the meter
 * and the decision cannot drift (audit 2026-08-22 P2-14).
 *
 * `grepDecisive` answers the one question the "move Grep into the bash skip list"
 * decision is blocked on: would this episode still have been kept without its Grep
 * entries? It is true ONLY when rule 4 decided AND the non-Grep entries alone fall
 * short — an edit-driven episode that happens to contain Greps is not evidence that
 * Grep carries research episodes.
 *
 * READ THE DENOMINATOR BEFORE READING `grepDecisive: 0`. It is a vacuous zero whenever
 * no episode contains a Grep at all, and that is the state measured on 2026-08-25:
 * across 555 instrumented episodes, `sum(readCount) = sum(grepCount) = 0`, and the `Grep`
 * tool was invoked **0 times in the entire 1111-transcript history on this machine**.
 * So "grepDecisive is 0, therefore Grep is safe to skip" is not an inference this counter
 * supports here — it never had the chance to fire. (The decision it was built for is
 * separately moot on that corpus: skipping a tool nobody calls saves 0ms.) Same shape as
 * the FTS5 `rowid = ? AND fts MATCH ?` trap this repo already paid for — a predicate that
 * cannot return true reports the defect as absent.
 *
 * The same measurement shows rules 4 and `buildImmediateObservation`'s `isReviewPattern`
 * are BOTH dormant, for a reason that has nothing to do with Grep: `readCount` counts
 * `Read || Grep`, and `Read` is filtered out at both layers (scripts/post-tool-use.sh
 * records it to `reads-<project>.txt` and exits; SKIP_TOOLS returns early in Node), so the
 * rule's only remaining input is a tool that is never called. Last observation the review
 * branch produced: 133 days ago, 111 lifetime.
 *
 * D#171 proposed the obvious repair — re-point rule 4 at `episode.filesRead`, populated at
 * hook.mjs:228 before this function runs, the same way rule 3 already reads
 * `episode.files`. MEASURED 2026-08-25: IT DOES NOT WORK TODAY, and the reason is dated,
 * not structural. Both halves matter, and the pre-tag review corrected the first draft of
 * each.
 *
 * Unlike the Grep case the denominator is real: `Read` fires 1861 times across the
 * 1114-transcript history (9.1% of all tool calls; the transcripts hold records spanning
 * 2026-08-13..08-25, so that is a live rate, not a lifetime counter). But `filesRead` is a
 * per-FLUSH slice, not a per-episode total — flushEpisodeWithDb renames and consumes
 * `reads-<project>.txt` on every flush. COMPARE THE TWO RATES ON THE SAME WINDOW: the
 * `episode_significance` metric rows cover three ACTIVE days (08-22 / 08-24 / 08-25; 08-23
 * has no file), 607 flushes; the transcripts touched in that window carry 596 Reads. That
 * is 0.98 Reads per episode. The first draft said 0.8 by dividing a 12-day Read rate by a
 * 3-day flush rate — two windows, one ratio, which is the same shape of error v3.80.0
 * recorded as "reading a lifetime counter as an active rate".
 *
 * At ~1 Read per episode a threshold of 8 is out of reach, and the 90-day sample agrees:
 * `files_read` is non-empty on 34 of 1872 rows (1.8%), p50 1 / p95 5 / max 8, exactly ONE
 * row reaching 8 — and that column is a SUPERSET of `episode.filesRead` (hook-llm.mjs
 * merges searched files in), so the true field is smaller. Two caveats on that sample, both
 * from the review: it only covers SIGNIFICANT episodes (saveEpisodeImmediate is gated on
 * `isSignificant`), which is ~8% of flushes and structurally excludes the population rule 4
 * would change; and 90 days starts AFTER the break below.
 *
 * THE RULE WAS NOT ALWAYS UNREACHABLE — do not write "structurally". Non-empty `files_read`
 * by month, with the count reaching the threshold of 8:
 *
 *     2026-02    35/  78  44.9%   >=8:  3   max 11
 *     2026-03   603/1004  60.1%   >=8: 49   max 53
 *     2026-04   314/ 621  50.6%   >=8: 28   max 33
 *     2026-05     8/ 129   6.2%   >=8:  0
 *     2026-06     5/ 754   0.7%   >=8:  0
 *     2026-07     8/ 919   0.9%   >=8:  1
 *     2026-08    20/ 193  10.4%   >=8:  0
 *     lifetime reaching >=8: 81
 *
 * For three consecutive months this field fed the threshold at a real rate. The break is
 * sharp: 2026-05-08 reads 11%, 05-09 onward reads 0.
 *
 * "THE REACHABLE INPUT IS THE EPISODE BOUNDARY" WAS WRONG — D#174 investigated it and the
 * boundary never moved. One query falsifies the whole family of boundary explanations:
 * measure the SIBLING column the same producer writes. `files_modified` is non-empty on
 * 85-98% of rows every month from 2026-02 through 2026-08, averaging 2.0-2.6 paths, and it
 * does not so much as dip across the break — while `files_read` goes 60% -> 1%. Episodes
 * still carry ~2 edits each; they just stopped carrying reads. A smaller boundary would have
 * taken both columns down together. Consistent with that, nothing in this repo changed at the
 * break: zero commits on 05-08/05-09, scripts/post-tool-use.sh byte-identical from 03-29 to
 * 05-24, hooks/hooks.json byte-identical from 04-22 to 05-10, and EPISODE_BUFFER_SIZE /
 * EPISODE_TIME_GAP_MS / isRelatedToEpisode untouched since 2026-02-11.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY SET THE RATE (probed, not read): a flush consumed reads-<project>.txt
 * unconditionally but only PERSISTED it when the episode was significant
 * (flushEpisodeGroup saves on `isSignificant`, and unlinks the flush file otherwise). So a
 * buffered-but-insignificant flush — a successful `npm test` on its own, say — swallowed every
 * Read accumulated since the previous flush and wrote none of them anywhere. Measured in a
 * sandbox: seed 2 Reads, fire one such flush, and 0 observations are saved, the reads-file is
 * gone, and the NEXT (edit-bearing, significant) observation carries `files_read=[]`.
 *
 * PAST TENSE SINCE v3.83.0: D#178 is FIXED. `flushEpisodeWithDb` now decides significance
 * before it touches the file, and an insignificant flush leaves it in place for the next
 * saving one (`QWEN_MEM_READS_CARRY=0` restores the old order). Two numbers in the
 * paragraph above were also wrong and are corrected here rather than left to be re-quoted:
 * the significant share is ~59%, not "~4-8%" — the `episode_significance` meter reads 40.7%
 * INsignificant over n=938 across three active days — and the 92-96% figure D#178 was filed
 * on came from the same slip. What the loss actually was, replayed over 1122 real
 * transcripts through this file's own batcher (`benchmark/episode-flush-replay.mjs`):
 * 42.2% of the Read paths a flush consumed destroyed, 72.7% of significant flushes
 * carrying none. Same measurement pass as CHANGELOG v3.83.0, CLAUDE.md and README — quoting
 * a second pass here would be the stitched-across-runs error one file at a time.
 *
 * The D#171 conclusion below is UNAFFECTED and that is worth stating explicitly, because
 * the fix moves the quantity its arithmetic used. Post-fix the carried distinct set runs
 * median 1, p95 6, max 21 per delivering flush — still nowhere near rule 4's threshold of
 * 8 on a per-EPISODE basis, and rule 4 does not read this field anyway.
 *
 * Note the first version of that probe used `echo hello` as its "insignificant" entry.
 * detectBashSignificance drops it, so the episode had zero entries, flushEpisode
 * early-returned at `entries.length === 0`, the reads were never touched — and the probe
 * confidently reported the opposite conclusion. An insignificant entry must be asserted into
 * the buffer before it proves anything.
 *
 * D#171 closed as won't-fix-as-specified: the repair it named does not work at the current
 * cadence, and re-pointing the rule would move the dormancy to a field nobody suspects.
 * That closure stands, and D#174 no longer offers a reason to reopen it — the rule's own
 * input (`readCount`, which counts Read/Grep ENTRIES, and Read never reaches Node) is a
 * different quantity from `filesRead` and is untouched by any of the above.
 *
 * EXACTLY ONE claim above is pinned by a test, and deliberately so (D#175). Every number
 * here is a corpus measured at a timestamp — a test over those would be a snapshot that
 * rots and gets edited into greenness. The per-FLUSH claim is different in kind: it is a
 * property of code (the reads-file is renamed aside, then the copy is unlinked), and if
 * someone later makes reads accumulate across flushes, every "out of reach at ~1 Read per
 * episode" sentence above silently becomes false. That is the one this closure rests on,
 * so `tests/feature-sweep-hooks.test.mjs` → "the reads-file is consumed, not accumulated
 * (D#175)" drives two real flushes through the subprocess and asserts the second one starts
 * empty. Rename-becomes-copy and the dropped unlink are separate mutations caught by
 * separate assertions there — one does not cover the other.
 *
 * THAT ALARM DID NOT FIRE FOR D#178, and the reason is worth keeping. Both of its flushes
 * are SIGNIFICANT (each buffers a `.sql` Write), so both take the collect branch under the
 * new order too — the v3.83.0 change walked straight underneath a guard installed one
 * commit earlier to catch exactly "reads accumulate across flushes". Its sibling cases in
 * the same file now cover the insignificant arm, in both flag positions and in the
 * multi-session shape; a per-flush guard whose fixture only ever exercises one arm of the
 * branch it guards is covering the arm nobody was going to change.
