// Two session identifiers coexist in this codebase:
//   • mem-internal id: `hook-<project>-<hash>`, produced by getSessionId().
//     handleUserPrompt writes it into user_prompts / sdk_sessions.content_session_id
//     / observations.memory_session_id. Treat as the ONLY valid WHERE / JOIN key
//     for those three tables.
//   • CC UUID: `hookData.session_id` from stdin. Use ONLY for
//     session_handoffs.session_id (parallel-session scoping, per bf121aa).
// Mixing them silently breaks everything — UPDATE matches 0 rows, SELECT returns
// empty, buildAndSaveHandoff early-returns, no throw. Precedent: v2.33.1 shipped
// with the two mixed since 2026-04-12; 48 stale 'active' sessions + 0 handoffs
// for projects--mem went unnoticed for 4 days. Keep the split or document why

// Audit 2026-09-02 P1-8. `hook.mjs` is ONE entry point for seven events, so every static
// import is paid by every event — PostToolUse, the highest-frequency one, was loading 85
// modules (1.37 MB) to use a handful. The six modules below are loaded inside the handler
// that needs them instead: patha-exclude-meter, hook-update, hook-optimize, adopt-cli,
// upgrade-banner. Measured marginal cost of the largest, same process: hook-update
// 9.4 ms, hook-optimize 5.9, the rest 0.5-2.4 each. (registry-recommend, 5.1 ms, was a
// sixth entry until the skill-registry subsystem was removed — see docs/audits/20260906-145304.md.)
//
// A failing dynamic import lands in the dispatcher's tail catch -> recordHookError, the
// same place a failing static import would have landed the whole process; each site keeps
// whatever local try/catch it already had, so a missing module degrades exactly one
// feature rather than the event.
//
// Three named by the audit are deliberately NOT converted, because the reason they are
// loaded is not that nobody looked:
//   * hook-llm.mjs (+16.3 ms, the single largest) — `flushEpisode` is SYNCHRONOUS and on
//     the PostToolUse path, and it calls `saveEpisodeImmediate` from that module. Lazy
//     loading needs either an async rewrite of the flush path or extracting the function,
//     and extraction does not pay: `saveEpisodeImmediate` reaches `saveObservation`, which
//     pulls tfidf / observation-write / activity / maintain-core anyway — only
//     haiku-client would actually stop loading.
//   * lib/db-backup.mjs and lib/compress-core.mjs (<=2.4 ms each) — their call sites sit
//     in `runSessionStartAutoMaintain` and `handleAutoCompress`, both synchronous. Turning
//     two functions and their callers async across a background-worker path costs more
//     risk than the milliseconds are worth.

/**
 * PostToolUseFailure — the event that carries tool calls the HOST judged failed (D#170).
 *
 * WHY A SECOND ENTRY POINT AT ALL. `PostToolUse` does not fire for a failed tool call;
 * Claude Code routes those here. Registering only `PostToolUse` therefore made this
 * plugin blind to every host-flagged failure, and the only "failures" error-recall ever
 * saw were commands that exited 0 while printing error-ish text — the classic shape
 * being `cmd 2>&1 | tail`, where the pipe launders a failure into a success. Verified on
 * the 2.1.241 bundle (the event and its schema) and by live probe (two genuinely failing
 * Bash calls, one with a full stack frame, left zero trace in the episode buffer and the
 * events table while the successful calls either side were recorded).
 *
 * THE PAYLOAD IS NOT PostToolUse'S. There is no `tool_response`; the failure text is in
 * `error`, and `is_interrupt` marks a user cancellation. Reading `tool_response` here
 * would find undefined and silently do nothing — which is exactly how this class of
 * wiring bug stays invisible, so the field names are asserted in the tests.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NARROWER THAN THE EVENT. Only `Bash` (this surface queries on a command
 * plus its output; no other tool has that shape), only when the failure came from a
 * PROGRAM rather than from the agent's own tool chain (lib/tool-refusal.mjs — 68.9% of
 * host-flagged failures on the maintainer's machine were guardrails working), and NOT
 * feeding the episode buffer. That last exclusion is scope, not oversight: episode
 * entries flow into LLM summarisation and the bugfix save-nudge, whose behaviour under a
 * sudden influx of failures has not been measured, and this change is already worth a
 * 3.5x increase in this surface's firing volume.
 *
 * NO `isHardError` GATE HERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT — stated because review found it
 * unwritten and it is a real semantic difference between the two entry points. On the
 * PostToolUse path the host says nothing about success, so `isHardError` has to GUESS
 * from vocabulary whether a command failed; here the host has already ruled, and
 * re-deriving its verdict from the text would only discard cases. The measurable
 * consequence: `Segmentation fault (core dumped)` and a Rust `panicked at` both score
 * `isHardError === false` (the first has no error word, the second loses on `\bpanic\b`'s
 * word boundary), so until this event they could not reach term extraction at all. They
 * can now. That is the coverage this event was wired for, not an oversight — but it does
 * mean ERROR_NAMER_RE's `SIG…`/`panicked` alternatives went live here first.
 *
 * Off switch: CLAUDE_MEM_ERROR_RECALL_ON_FAILURE=off.

/**
 * Sweep abandoned `*.lock` files out of RUNTIME_DIR on SessionStart.
 *
 * "Stale" has to mean ABANDONED, not merely old. Until A20260905-R5-P1-1 this swept on AGE
 * ALONE (pid was consulted only for locks YOUNGER than STALE_LOCK_MS, i.e. exactly the ones
 * it was going to keep anyway), so a lock older than 30s was unlinked no matter who held it.
 * `runtime/install.lock` — lib/proc-lock.mjs, taken by `install.mjs repair`,
 * `install.mjs rebuild-binding`, hook-update.installExtractedRelease and scripts/launch.mjs —
 * guards a critical section that routinely runs 30s–2min (npm install in staging is capped at
 * 60s, npm rebuild in smoke at 120s). Any parallel Claude Code window starting up during that
 * span deleted the live holder's lock; the next installer then acquired it and began renaming
 * files into the same install dir, which is the torn mixed-version install (server vN + hook
 * vN+1) proc-lock.mjs's header exists to prevent.
 *
 * Policy now: a recorded pid that is ALIVE (or alive-but-not-ours, EPERM) is spared until
 * ABANDONED_LOCK_MS; a provably-dead pid (ESRCH) is swept at any age; a lock with no usable
 * pid falls back to STALE_LOCK_MS, as before.
 *
 * Liveness of the two real lock families does not depend on this sweeper, so tightening it
 * cannot wedge either: hook-episode.acquireLock() preempts a >30s episode lock itself at
 * acquire time, and proc-lock.acquireLock() steals on age OR dead pid at 5 min.
