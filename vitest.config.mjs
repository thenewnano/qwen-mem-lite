    // MED-5): MEM_QUIET_HOOKS=1 in a dev shell leaks into every spawned hook subprocess
    // (…process.env spread) and silently flips descriptive-stdout assertions; CLAUDE_MEM_DIR
    // overrides the HOME-based data dir (resolveDataDir), so a dev who relocated their real
    // DB would have e2e subprocesses read/write it. Tests that exercise these vars set them
    // explicitly (vi.stubEnv or child env), which overrides this global ''.
    // CLAUDE_MEM_TEST_GUARD (audit 2026-08-22 P2-4): clearing CLAUDE_MEM_DIR stops a
    // relocated dev DB from being READ, but a test that never sets the var resolves the
    // default — the maintainer's real ~/.claude-mem-lite — and writes to it. That
    // happened during the v3.73.0 release. With the guard on, lib/resolve-data-dir.mjs
    // REDIRECTS the live data dir to a per-run sandbox — in this process AND in every
    // subprocess that inherits the ambient env (the same channel by which the var goes
    // missing). It blocks exactly one directory, the real one; it does NOT refuse
    // everything outside os.tmpdir(), which was an earlier design that resolve-data-dir's
    // own comment explains at length was wrong (fixtures hardcode /tmp, os.tmpdir()

      // allowlist gives a NEW module no way to announce itself: it is simply absent, and
      // absence reads identically to "deliberately out".
      //
      // Measured 2026-09-07 at 02072c7, whole suite, each candidate temporarily added via
      // `--coverage.include` (name set taken from coverage-final.json, NOT the text report,
      // whose ~19-char truncation makes a full-name grep a false negative):
      //
      //     24 shipped modules were outside the gate with NO stated reason — 10,137 lines,
      //     against 30,305 inside it. The gate could see 62.5% of shipped JS while this
      //     file's own comments named exactly three exclusions.
      //
      // Among the invisible: search-engine.mjs (72.4% stmts / 275), hook-optimize.mjs
      // (76.1% / 482), scoring-sql.mjs (100% / 24) — i.e. the retrieval core the whole
