// D#134 MEDIUM-2 — both budgets are DERIVED from the longest a slot can
// legitimately be held, not hand-set. They used to be the literals 30000 and
// 60000, sized for the ~15-20s LLM calls of the time; v3.66.0 raised the
// background call budget to 45s and neither literal followed, leaving two
// silent failures:
//
//   • wait budget < hold: with both slots busy the third worker gave up after
//     30s while a holder was still legitimately working, and its caller fell
//     through to degraded storage — the observation is SAVED but never
//     enriched. Nothing errors; the row just quietly lacks aliases/lesson.
//   • stale threshold barely above hold: a 45s holder had 15s of margin, so a
//     slow SIGTERM, GC pause, or loaded machine let a PEER delete the live
//     holder's file. That drops it out of `active`, and the peer then sees
//     room that does not exist — more than LLM_SEM_MAX concurrent calls.

// working holder, which is why the ts written at acquire never needs

// Does THIS process currently hold the (single, pid-named) slot?
//
// The slot file is one per process, and until the MCP LLM legs went async in
// v3.68.0 two acquires could not overlap inside one: execFileSync held the event
// loop, so a second tools/call was not even read from stdio while the first was
// in its LLM call. The EEXIST branch below encodes that era's assumption — "we
// are inside acquire and therefore do NOT hold a slot, so it is always stale" —
// and unlinks unconditionally. With two concurrent mem_optimize handlers that
// unlink would delete a LIVE sibling's slot: the cross-process count stops
// seeing it (so more than LLM_SEM_MAX `claude -p` children run at once), and the
// first holder's release then unlinks the second holder's file. This bookkeeping
// makes the EEXIST branch's claim true again by keeping same-process acquires out
// of it — they wait for the holder instead.
//
// A TIMESTAMP, not a boolean, and the difference is load-bearing: a boolean has no
// self-heal, so one caller that acquired and never released would deadlock every
// later LLM call in a long-lived MCP server for the life of the process — strictly
// worse than the race it fixes. Past LLM_SEM_STALE_MS the local record is treated
// as broken bookkeeping and we fall through to the file-side logic, which is the
// same age escape hatch the reaper applies to other processes' slots. 0 = not held.
