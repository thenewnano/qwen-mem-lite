// D#192 (filed as D#189, re-scoped after measurement). These two are REACHABILITY bounds, not ranking bounds — the D#172 shape, and
// the fifth surface it has been found on. Both SELECTs order by pure `created_at_epoch
// DESC`; the JS below then re-sorts every candidate by `valueDensity`, a composite of
// typeQuality x impBoost(1.0/1.5/2.0) x lessonBoost(1.0/1.3) / sqrt(cost) whose dynamic
// range is far wider than the (1,2] that recency contributes. So the key the SQL sorts
// on barely participates in the final order, and anything past the LIMIT is unreachable
// however well it scores.
//
// Named rather than inline so benchmark/keyctx-pool-replay.mjs can patch a twin and
// price a change to them. Keep the `const NAME = <int>;` shape — that ruler patches the
// DECLARATION by regex and throws when the anchor moves. (Said `export const` until
// D#207: the names went module-private once knip could finally see this file and
// reported them as permanently unused, and the ruler's regex was widened to match a bare
// `const`, which is what its rerank-pool sibling always matched.)
//
// OBS was 50 through v3.86.0 and is now an OOM backstop, not a relevance gate. What the
// ruler measured before the change (2026-09-02T06:11Z, 11 projects with >=20 live rows,
// budget 2000, AGAINST THE 50/10 TREE — reproduce with `--population --ref-obs 50
// --ref-sess 10` and with `--wide-obs 50 --wide-sess 10`, which runs the comparison
// backwards; the bare command now reports 0/11 because shipped is the wider bound):
// the 50-row bound truncated the pool in 3 of 11 projects, and lifting it
// alone moved the injected block in 2 of 11 — 8 rows newly reachable against 2 displaced,
// for +81 and +16 tokens. Selection here is NOT monotone, so a displaced row is a real
// cost and the ruler prints it as a first-class number (`--why-displaced` names the rows
// and the gate that dropped each).
//
// Both displaced rows lost their slot to the 3-per-type diversity cap. That is not a
// three-way discrimination: the token budget does not bind on this corpus (651 of 2000 in
// the widest arm's largest project) and the file-overlap `continue` that used to sit in
// the selector was UNREACHABLE and has since been deleted (D#197) — so the cap is
// currently the only gate that can fire. ("below" until v3.88.0; there is nothing below
// any more, and a reader who went looking found the sentence outliving its referent.)
//
// 200 is ~2x the largest pool observed (107). The ruler CANNOT distinguish 200 from 500
// on this corpus — every bound >= the largest pool is one arm, identical in both
// selection and cost — so this value is a headroom choice, not a measured optimum.
// computeAdaptiveWindows NARROWS the windows as velocity rises (tier3 60d -> 30d -> 14d),
// so activity counteracts pool growth instead of driving it: the largest pool here is the
// lowest-velocity high-volume project (1.14 obs/day, 107 rows) while the only project a
// band up has 2.9x the velocity and 29% of the pool. A draft of this comment had that
// backwards.
//
// Cost is PER PROJECT: ~2.7x where the pool is 107, ~2.0x at 59, ~1.5x at 62, and
// unchanged (inferred, not measured) for the eight projects whose pool never reached 50.
// Once per SessionStart, both arms in the low single-digit milliseconds. It is NOT a clean
// function of pool growth — the 59-row project grows less than the 62-row one and costs
// more, on two independent harnesses, because fixed per-call work (SQL fetch,
// estimateTokens, JSON.parse, the unchanged summary half) sets the denominator. Three
// drafts were wrong here in three ways: a point estimate (2.65x), a global range
// (2.1x-3.8x) no measurement produced, and a causal claim n=3 refutes. Absolute
// milliseconds are not quotable. Re-derive with `--cost --wide-obs 50 --wide-sess 10
// --project <p>`, which prices the widening in the correct direction.
//
// SESS stays 10 DELIBERATELY, and the discriminator is `sessDisplaced = 0` in 11 of 11
// projects, not the observation column. Widening it to 40 displaces no summary at all —
// it is PURELY ADDITIVE, so that LIMIT is a volume cap and not the D#172 shape, which is
// the actual reason it does not need lifting. (It also changed zero observations, but
// that only says the obs side is unaffected.) What widening does buy is 130 newly injected
// summaries, roughly tripling the emitted block on the largest projects. It truncates MORE
// projects than the obs bound, 5 of 11 against 3 of 11, which is what made the original
// review propose it first; truncation count is not harm.
// Module-private, like their siblings RERANK_POOL_SAME_PROJECT / RERANK_POOL_CROSS_PROJECT
// in hook-memory.mjs. Nothing imports them: `benchmark/keyctx-pool-replay.mjs` rewrites
// these DECLARATIONS with a regex over this file's text, which needs no export, and being
// exported by habit put two permanently-unused names into knip's report the moment D#207
// made this module visible to it. Raising a baseline is the wrong way to hold a name
// (v3.70.0 precedent, #9675). The replay's `patchConst` matches `const <NAME> = <n>;`.

 * R12 A2 — this used to be `observations.length >= 3 ? observations : fallbackObs`,
 * written inline at BOTH consumer sites. The two row sets come from different windows
 * (obsPool's low-speed tier1 is 48h/imp>=1; the fallback query is 24h/imp>=1 OR
 * 7d/imp>=2) and neither contains the other, so a whole-set switch could hand back
 * FEWER rows than it was given — measured on tests/hook-context.test.mjs's own `thin(n)`
 * fixture: 2 rows in the DB, both selected, and a 0-byte context block, against 241 bytes
 * and 3 table rows at n=3. Output was non-monotonic in corpus size, and the victims were
 * exactly the thin/new projects the 60-day tier exists to serve. (An earlier revision of
 * this line said 391 bytes, carried over from the audit's own differently-seeded fixture
 * rather than measured here.)
 *
 * Top-up, not truncate-to-three: the union never renders fewer rows than the old
 * expression did on any input, which a "fill to 3" fix would not hold — at 0 selected rows
 * the fallback query's own LIMIT 5 already governs, and capping at 3 would have been a
 * second, unrelated behaviour change. Growth is bounded: the union only runs below
 * MIN_LOCAL_OBS, so the table gains at most two rows.
 *
 * The COUNT never shrinks; the composition can, and that is a ranking decision rather than
 * an accident. At the uncapped table site this only adds. At the `.slice(0, MIN_LOCAL_OBS)`
 * site the selected rows are PREPENDED, so with 1 local row and 3+ fallback rows the third
 * fallback title is evicted — still three rows, one of them now local. Exhaustive
 * enumeration over 42,436 ordered input pairs: 0 cases render fewer rows, 3,000 evict a
 * fallback row that way, max gain 2. Preferring the project's own rows over cross-project
 * ones inside a fixed window is the intended order, and saying so is the point: a new
 * population entering a limit-bounded window without a stated ranking is this repo's
 * recorded failure shape.
