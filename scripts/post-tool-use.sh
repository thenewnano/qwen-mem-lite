# Claude Code plugin-disable guard (audit P3-4).
# install.mjs writes DIRECT hook entries into ~/.claude/settings.json, so disabling the
# plugin in the Claude UI leaves them firing. hook.mjs exits 0 for that case, but the
# Read fast-path below never reaches Node: it kept appending to reads-<project>.txt on
# EVERY Read, while the 24h sweep that reaps those files (sweepOrphanEpisodeFiles, via
# runSessionStartAutoMaintain) sits behind that same Node-side exit — unbounded growth
# in runtime/ for a plugin the user believes is off.
# MUST agree with hook.mjs isPluginExplicitlyDisabled(): same $HOME/.claude/settings.json
# (NOT CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR — hook.mjs resolves it via homedir()), same plugin key, and the
# same fail-open-on-unreadable semantics (its try/catch returns false). Parity pinned by
# tests/post-tool-use-disabled.test.mjs.
# Cheap by construction: no `node`, no external command on this ~5ms per-tool-call path.
# `-r` covers missing/unreadable in one builtin test, and `$(<file)` slurps the whole file
# for ONE regex — measured +0.4ms/call vs +4.0ms for a `while read` loop over the same
# 239-line settings.json (bash pays a syscall + a regex per line there).
# The ERE (not a `==` glob) is what keeps a MINIFIED single-line settings.json from
# matching `"<key>": true, … "other": false` as a false positive: the pattern is anchored
# to the key, so only that key's own value can satisfy it.
# Deliberately NOT applied to the Node handoff at the tail: hook.mjs already self-guards
# there, so a bash false positive could only lose data, never save work.
