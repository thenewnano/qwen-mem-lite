# ── Frozen-corpus guard ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The LIVE replay benchmarks dump frozen corpora so a later A/B can be run over the same
# denominator. `benchmark/results/` is gitignored, but that is one door and these files
# take an arbitrary path from --dump / --shapes / --corpus. One of the two families is
# genuinely sensitive: `*-shapes-*.json` carries real failing commands and their real
# stderr, pulled from live transcripts. (The citation corpus holds no transcript text —
# its longest string is a project path — but it does carry session UUIDs and absolute
# paths, so it is out too.)
#
# Scope, stated honestly because the first version of this comment overclaimed: this
# matches the gitignored directory OR the dated dump NAMING CONVENTION. It is a convention
# reminder, not a content gate — `--dump f.json` writes a file this cannot see. Widened
# below to not require the date and to accept `_` separators, which covers the shapes the
# benchmarks actually emit; a real gate would have to scan staged blobs for session-UUID
# and absolute-path shapes, which is a bigger change than a release should carry.
