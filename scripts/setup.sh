# The same three locations lib/data-paths.mjs defines, under the same names. This script
# carried ONE variable for all three, and under CLAUDE_MEM_DIR that variable is the CODE
# dir — so every question about the DATABASE was asked of a directory holding none. This
# repo has now had that confusion three times (v6.3.0, the same fix reintroduced with the
# halves swapped, and here), which is why the names are spelled out rather than inferred.
#
#   CODE_DIR    — ALWAYS homedir. settings.json and the MCP registration bake absolute
#                 paths to server.mjs / hook.mjs under it, so it must not follow the
#                 relocation env var. Owns node_modules and the run-once install markers.
#   DB_DIR      — follows CLAUDE_MEM_DIR. Owns claude-mem-lite.db and its sidecars.
#   RUNTIME_DIR — follows CLAUDE_MEM_RUNTIME_DIR, else DB_DIR/runtime. Owns state a hook
#                 writes and another component reads back (see .deps-broken below).
#
# ASK the shared resolver rather than re-deriving its rules (absolute-only, "undefined" /
# "null" rejected) in a second language. lib/resolve-data-dir.mjs is a leaf module — node:
# builtins only — so it still loads with node_modules missing, which is the state the
# .deps-broken flag exists to describe. Gated on an override actually being set: with
# neither var the resolver returns exactly these defaults, and SessionStart should not pay a
# node spawn to be told that. A resolver that is missing (truncated tree) or that throws
# (invalid override) leaves the defaults in place; the Node side rejects a bad value loudly
# enough on its own, and aborting here would fail the user's session start.

# degrades — pre-tool-recall, post-tool-use, session-start all import better-sqlite3
# and exit on the require() error. v2.79: write a JSON flag to runtime/.deps-broken
# and hook.mjs SessionStart surfaces it in the Claude context as a HIGH-VISIBILITY
# block; success branches remove the flag so a self-heal stays visible too.
#
# ...and that contract is a two-directory agreement, not a filename. hook.mjs renders the
# flag from `join(RUNTIME_DIR, '.deps-broken')`, where RUNTIME_DIR is
# `resolveRuntimeDir(resolveDataDir(CLAUDE_MEM_DIR))` (hook-shared.mjs). Hardcoding a
# homedir path here meant that under CLAUDE_MEM_DIR / CLAUDE_MEM_RUNTIME_DIR the writer and
# the reader named two different directories, so the one surface that says "your hooks are
# degraded" rendered nothing on exactly the installs that had relocated. Measured
# 2026-09-14: flag planted where this script wrote it → banner 0 times; planted where
# hook.mjs reads → 1. Same SPLIT shape lib/resolve-data-dir.mjs documents; it survived
# because tests/runtime-dir-single-home.test.mjs sweeps `walkShipped`, which is every
# shipped .mjs/.js — a bash hook is structurally outside that population. RUNTIME_DIR is
# resolved once at the top of this file.
#
# ONLY this marker follows the override. `.mcp-dedup-v2.78` and `.residue-warned-v2.55`
# below are one-shot state about THIS MACHINE's install — a ~/.claude.json edit and a
# settings.json warning, not state a hook hands to another component — so they stay under

# 6b. Binding probe: node_modules/better-sqlite3 PRESENT is not node binding
#     WORKING. npm >= 12 blocks install/lifecycle scripts by default, so the
#     `npm install` above exits 0 with the native .node binding never compiled
#     (and a Node major upgrade strands a stale-ABI binding the same way) —
#     pre-v3.58 this branch called mark_deps_ok on directory presence alone,
#     leaving every hook dead with a false-green flag until the MCP server's
#     own probe ran. Probe via the shared fix point lib/binding-probe.mjs
#     (opens a :memory: DB; auto-rebuilds with --dangerously-allow-all-scripts,
#     plain-rebuild fallback for older npm). The ABI-keyed marker lives inside
#     node_modules/ — WITH the tree it certifies — so healthy sessions cost one
#     stat, a new plugin-cache version dir (fresh node_modules) re-probes, and
#     a Node upgrade (new ABI) re-probes. While broken, every SessionStart
#     retries the rebuild until it heals.
# Delegates to scripts/binding-probe-cli.mjs — a real module file, NOT an inline
# `node -e` string. That inline form SIGSEGV'd during exit after a verified-good
# rebuild (Node v24.18, ~50% of runs), so a successful heal returned 139 and this
# branch recorded .deps-broken over a healthy install; it also could not contain
# an apostrophe without truncating the shell command. See that file's header.
