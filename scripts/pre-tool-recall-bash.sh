# qwen-mem-lite: PreToolUse:Bash prefilter for file recall.
#
# Why this hook exists (docs/audits/20260926-154904-session-history-analysis-r2.md, N1):
# pre-tool-recall.js fires on Edit|Write|NotebookEdit|Read, and on Opus 5.5 only 18.0% of
# file edits and 14.7% of file reads went through those tools — the rest were `sed -i`,
# `cat > f <<EOF`, python patches and `sed -n`/`cat`. The face with the highest measured
# cite rate (41.7%) fell to ~1/9 of its former firing rate without a single error.
#
# Why a bash prefilter: Bash is most tool calls, and most of them (git, npm, vitest, gh,
# grep) read or write no single file. Starting Node for each costs ~55 ms; this script
# costs a bash start and two regex tests, and hands off only commands that LOOK like they
# view or write a file. It is deliberately loose — pre-tool-recall.js parses the command
# properly (lib/bash-file-targets.mjs) and exits silently when there is no target.
#
# The file name must contain `pre-tool-recall`: lib/citation-tracker.mjs attributes a
# transcript's hook attachment to the pretool face by that substring of the hook COMMAND,
# and this command line is the only one the transcript records for a Bash firing.

# Read the payload FIRST, before any early exit: exiting with stdin unread hands the
# writer an EPIPE (seen as an uncaught error in this repo's own test harness when the
# off switch fired before the write finished). Only the first 256 KB is kept; the rest is
# drained, or a multi-megabyte heredoc still hits EPIPE (pre-ship delta review P3-6).

# …and one of: a view/write verb at the START of a command (after `;`, `&&`, `||`, `(`
# or a newline — NOT after a single `|`, where `| head` / `| sed -n` read stdin, which
# is most Bash tails), a pipe into `tee`, an inline or heredoc program (`python3 -c`,
# `node -e`, `python3 - <<`; a plain `node x.mjs` runs a file, it does not edit one),
# or an output redirection.
# JSON escapes a tab as `\t`, so it counts as whitespace here; wrappers (`time`, `env`,
# `sudo -u x`, `timeout -s KILL 5`) and assignments may sit before the verb.

# Every token class below excludes the backslash, so no token can swallow a JSON escape

# match superlinear: a 149 KB tab-separated heredoc took 8.8 s, over the hook's 3 s timeout
# (pre-ship delta review P2-B). For the same reason a `\t` is whitespace, not a command start.
# Wrapper options that take a value (`sudo -u root`, `timeout -s KILL 5`) are one token.
