// scripts/post-tool-recall.js — PostToolUse companion to pre-tool-recall.js for
// the bind-salience forcing-function (component 2). After an Edit/Write, if a
// lesson surfaced for this file named an identifier that was present BEFORE the
// edit (recorded in the cooldown by pre-tool-recall.js) and is now GONE, emit a
// one-line non-blocking nudge. Only active under QWEN_MEM_SALIENCE=bind.
//
// Catches "you removed a required reference" lessons. It does NOT catch "you
// failed to ADD a call" (the identifier was never in the pre-edit file →
// presentIdents excluded it); that class is carried by the pre-edit
// BIND_DIRECTIVE, not here. See the spec's component-2 limits.
//
// Safety: readonly, no DB, exit 0 always. The cooldown path rule comes from
// lib/cooldown-path.mjs — it used to be inlined here "per the #8447 fast-path
// convention", but that exemption stopped applying to THIS script the moment it grew
// the four lib imports below (audit 2026-09-02 P1-1: the fourth copy; the previous
// round collapsed only three of four). A writer/reader disagreement on this name does
// not error — it reads a file nobody wrote, silently zeroing the bind-mode
// dropped-identifier check.
