// scripts/binding-probe-cli.mjs — SessionStart native-binding probe + bounded heal.
//
// Contract with scripts/setup.sh: exit 0 = binding usable NOW, non-zero = not.
// Everything human-readable goes to stderr — SessionStart stdout is a JSON
// envelope Claude Code parses, so this must never write there.
//
// Extracted (v3.60.1) from an inline `node --input-type=module -e '…'` string
// inside setup.sh. Two load-bearing reasons, both observed rather than assumed:
//   • That form CRASHED. The -e process SIGSEGV'd during exit after a
//     verified-good rebuild (Node v24.18, ~50% of runs, no fatal-error report
//     produced), so a SUCCESSFUL heal exited 139 and setup.sh wrote
//     .deps-broken over a healthy install. install.mjs::rebuildBinding doing
//     the same work as a normal module never reproduced it.
//   • It could not contain an apostrophe. The script was interpolated into a
//     single-quoted bash string, so a single `don't` in a comment truncated the
//     shell command — a footgun that fired during development of this fix.
//
// Rebuilds are bounded to 20s because setup.sh runs under the SessionStart hook
// cap (hooks/hooks.json timeout 30): letting the hook SIGKILL a mid-flight
// node-gyp would leave a partial .node with no flag written. On lock-miss or
// timeout, mark broken and defer to the MCP launch path (no cap, same lock).

  // NODE_MODULE_VERSION pair on lines 2-3, so `.split('\n')[0]` said WHERE but never
  // WHY — for the exact fault this probe exists to find.
  //
  // Flattening is inlined, NOT lib/binding-probe.mjs::flattenBindingError, because
  // this function is the fallback for a tree where lib/ failed to import — `helpers`

  // lib/-less tree and asserts parity with the shared helper.
