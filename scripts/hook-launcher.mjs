// scripts/hook-launcher.mjs — Self-healing wrapper for Node hook entry points.
//
// Why: pre-v2.84 a stale-manifest bug in hook-update.mjs could leave the
// install with a hook.mjs that imports lib/cite-back-hint.mjs (or any other
// newly-added module) while the file itself was never copied. The resulting
// ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND killed every hook fire, including the next auto-update
// that would have healed the install. v2.84.0 fixes the root cause; this
// launcher is defense-in-depth for similar future drift (corrupt download,
// half-applied install, manual file deletion).
//
// Behavior: try-import the target entry. On ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND originating
// from our install — either a missing relative module (e.url under the install
// dir) or a missing bare dependency like better-sqlite3 (e.url is undefined and
// the importer named in the message is under the install dir) — run
// `install.mjs repair` (rate-limited via a 6h marker file under runtime/) and
// retry the import once. That repair runs at SESSION-START ONLY; every other
// event records the breakage and defers (A20260905-R5-Q2, see attemptHeal).
// If repair is unavailable, deferred or fails, degrade quietly:
// these are best-effort memory hooks, so a broken/missing dependency emits one
// clean recovery line and exits 0 rather than dumping a Node stack trace on
// every fire. On any other (foreign) exception, re-throw so Node's default
// error surface is preserved.
//
// HARD constraint: pure node: imports only. Importing anything from lib/ here
// would defeat the entire purpose — the launcher must survive a broken
// install.

// override (two installers pointed at different override dirs would each see no swap in
// progress). `HOOK_RUNTIME_DIR` is override-aware and serves every marker another component
// reads back — the launcher's own breakage/heal markers, which `install.mjs doctor` reads,
// and the native-binding pair below. That second constant already existed here as
// `NB_RUNTIME_DIR` and was applied to only half this file's markers.
//
// Inline `||`, not `lib/resolve-data-dir.mjs::resolveRuntimeDir`, and this is the single

// work, so it imports only `node:` builtins on purpose — even a leaf lib module is a
// resolution it declines to make on the path whose job is surviving a broken install. The
// standalone hook scripts it mirrors (pre-tool-recall / post-tool-recall) honour the same
// variable and write 78 of every 79 of these markers, so reading a different dir would mean
// never healing. `resolveRuntimeDir` is the canonical rule (audit 2026-09-02 P1-14) and this
// is NOT identical to it: the resolver additionally makes a RELATIVE override absolute
// (`isAbsolute(raw) ? raw : resolve(raw)`), while this hands the relative value straight to
