// Caliber caveat, so the numbers are re-derivable rather than quotable: the six

    // This comment used to say "Always write, even on empty allRows, so the file's ts
    // stays fresh". It does not: `mergeCrossHookInjected` returns on line 268 when
    // `newIds` is empty, so a firing that emits nothing leaves the timestamp where it
    // was and the marker can age out of the dedup window. Corrected rather than
    // implemented — refreshing `ts` on an empty firing would EXTEND suppression on the
    // strength of an injection that did not happen, which is the opposite of what the
    // window is for. The practical consequence is only that the trigger condition for
    // D#193 is "PreToolUse emitted at least one row in the window", not "always".
    // D#188: namespaced on write too — otherwise a bare event id here would keep
    // blocking the same-numbered observation on the next UPS prompt. (An earlier
    // version of this comment also claimed it leaked into hook.mjs's
    // pathAInjectedIds; it reaches there, but suppresses nothing, because this
    // function stringifies every id and that consumer compares against a numeric
    // row id. That inertness is a separate live defect — D#193.)
