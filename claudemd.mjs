// Context-file steering (v3.13, two-layout since the Qwen Code fork): primitives for the
// project-tree managed block at <cwd>/CLAUDE.md AND <cwd>/QWEN.md, each with an on-demand
// detail doc at <cwd>/.claude/plugin_<slug>.md / <cwd>/.qwen/plugin_<slug>.md.
//
// Why here and not memdir.mjs: a host loads its project context file and the memory-dir
// MEMORY.md at EQUAL weight, so steering belongs in that context file (the canonical home
// for project instructions) — seeding MEMORY.md just pollutes an index meant for the
// user's own memories. This module mirrors the design shipped by the sibling
// code-graph-mcp plugin (claude-plugin/scripts/adopt.js) and the oh-my-claudecode
// versioned `<!-- :begin vN -->` managed-block pattern.
//
// Why TWO files, and which two: see the LAYOUTS comment below.
//
// The managed block is plugin-owned: it auto-refreshes when the shipped content
// drifts (version bump or template change), UNLESS CLAUDE_MEM_NO_TEMPLATE_REFRESH=1.
// User prose OUTSIDE the slug-scoped sentinel is never touched. The slug scope is
// what keeps this independent from code-graph-mcp's own block in the same file.
//
// See docs/CLAUDE-MD-STEERING-PLAN.md for rationale + migration.

// Two hosts, two context files, and they do not overlap: Claude Code loads the project
// CLAUDE.md (+ .claude/) and ignores QWEN.md; Qwen Code loads QWEN.md (+ .qwen/) and
// ignores CLAUDE.md — measured on Qwen Code 0.24.4, which loaded neither this repo's 20 KB
// CLAUDE.md nor any other, its context-file default being QWEN.md alone. A single target
// would therefore make the steering block invisible to whichever host it did not pick, and
// adopt cannot detect the host: its own CLI runs with no host env at all.
//
// So the managed block goes to BOTH, each file carrying its own slug-scoped sentinel, its
// own detail doc and its own state sidecar, and every read ORs across the pair. The cost is
// one file the other host ignores; the alternative is a silent no-op on half the user's
// sessions. Add a host by adding one line here.
