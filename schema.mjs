// triggers scoped to FTS-indexed columns via `AFTER UPDATE OF <cols>`. Before
// v27 the _au triggers fired on ANY row UPDATE — access_count / injection_count
// / last_accessed_at bumps (#8100 separation notwithstanding) caused wasted
// FTS delete+reinsert cycles and amplified SQLITE_CORRUPT_VTAB blast radius
// (project_non_obvious.md). Migration drops the old triggers once and lets
// ensureFTS recreate them with the scoped form.
//
// v28 (v2.47): observation_vectors orphan + stale-vocab cleanup. Live DBs had
// 2839/6429 (44%) orphaned rows (historic deletes during FK-OFF migrations)
// and 3282/6429 (51%) stale-vocab rows (rebuildVocabulary never pruned old
// versions before v2.47). Idempotent one-shot DELETE on ensureDb.
//
// v29 (v2.57.x): (1) sdk_sessions_id_invariant trigger guarding the v2.33.1
// mix pattern (memory_session_id and content_session_id must not be the same
// non-null value — they're different ID schemes). (2) lesson_retry_stats
// aggregate table tracking how often hook-llm.mjs retry path actually
// recovers a lesson (vs being a wasted Haiku call). Both purely additive.
//
// v30 (v2.57.x patch): trigger body fix — UUID-shape gate so test fixtures
// using short literal IDs ('sess-1') don't trigger. Initial v29 trigger
// fired on any equal non-null pair, breaking 60+ test scaffolds that write
// the same literal to both columns by helper convention. v30 forces
// DROP+CREATE so DBs that picked up the strict v29 trigger get the UUID-
// gated body. Required because `CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS` is a no-op
// when the trigger already exists, even with a different body.
// v31 (v2.70.0): deferred_work table — first-class carry-forward surface.
// Decoupled from observations: different decay semantics (no time decay; older
// items rank HIGHER as tech debt accumulates), different lifecycle (mutable
// status open→done|dropped vs immutable obs). Closure tied to obs via
// closed_by_obs_id FK with ON DELETE SET NULL (audit trail preserved).
// v32 (v2.73.2): citation-decay columns on observations — uncited_streak,
// cited_count, last_decided_session_id. Stop hook resolves injected obs as
// cited|uncited; 3 consecutive uncited → importance -1 (floor 0); 1 cited → +1
// (cap 3). last_decided_session_id makes Stop idempotent across multi-fire.
// v35 (v2.87.0): no DDL — version bumped only to force one full migration pass on
// existing DBs, which runs the one-shot observation_files orphan cleanup (and
// re-runs the v28 observation_vectors cleanup) to clear the backlog leaked while
// the warm-start fast-path left foreign_keys OFF. LATEST_MIGRATION_COLUMN is
// unchanged (no new column) — decay_seen_count still exists at v35.
// v36 (v2.89.0): no DDL — narrows events_fts_au to `AFTER UPDATE OF title, body`.
// The events FTS triggers (v2.31) were hand-written inline and inherited the
// pre-v27 broad `AFTER UPDATE ON events` form, so every importance / accessed_count
// / citation-decay bump thrashed events_fts (delete+reinsert) and reintroduced the
// SQLITE_CORRUPT_VTAB blast radius v27 fixed for the other FTS tables. Version
// bumped to force one migration pass; the conditional drop below replaces the
// legacy trigger on existing DBs. LATEST_MIGRATION_COLUMN unchanged (no new column).
// v37 (D#26): adds user_prompts.cc_session_id (additive, nullable). LATEST_MIGRATION_COLUMN
// MOVES to it so the half-migrated-DB self-heal fast-path covers the new column.
// v38 (R1): citation_log table — per-session invocation→cite funnel telemetry. One
// accumulating row per resolved session (injected_n / cited_n), written by
// recordCitationFunnel from applyCitationDecay's touched/promoted at Stop. Turns the
// per-obs cite counters (lifetime-cumulative) into a trendable per-session series so
// `citation-stats` can answer "is memory invocation effectiveness rising or falling".
// New TABLE (not a column) reached via CORE_SCHEMA's CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS on the
// forced migration pass; LATEST_MIGRATION_COLUMN unchanged (no new column) — same
// pattern as v35/v36.
// v39 (audit P1-5): migration_cleanups table — a sentinel registry that makes the
// one-shot DATA cleanups (orphan deletes, project-name normalization) RETRYABLE.
// They previously ran inside the version-gated migration body and were swallowed
// on failure AFTER the version stamp committed, so a failed cleanup could never
// re-run (the fast-path then skipped the whole body). They now run via
// runDeferredCleanups() on every ensureDb, each gated by a done-marker row: a
// failure leaves the marker unset and retries on the next open. New TABLE via
// CORE_SCHEMA on the forced pass; LATEST_MIGRATION_COLUMN unchanged (no new
// column) — same pattern as v35/v36/v38.
// v40 (round-5 audit HIGH): forces one migration pass so the now column-aware ensureFTS
// widens any STALE FTS table on existing DBs. Early-adopter stores created before a column
// was added to an FTS list (session_summaries_fts predates `remaining_items`, v2.2.0) carried
// a narrow FTS table forever — the old ensureFTS only created a table when absent, never
// widened it — while its triggers were rebuilt with the current wider column list, so every
// session_summaries UPDATE threw "no column named remaining_items" and was silently swallowed
// (Haiku summary enrichment lost every session). Pure index reheal (no data migration, no
// column drop); idempotent. New behavior via the forced pass; LATEST_MIGRATION_COLUMN
// unchanged (no new column) — same pattern as v35/v36/v38/v39.
// v41 (cross-turn late-citation): adds observations.last_cited_session_id (additive,
// nullable) — the promote idempotency key, split from last_decided_session_id so a
// citation landing in a LATER turn of the same session can still upgrade a
// previously-uncited obs (see applyCitationDecay). REAL new column, so unlike v38-v40
// this DOES advance LATEST_MIGRATION_COLUMN (→ observations.last_cited_session_id);
// existing DBs reach the ALTER because version 40 != 41 falls through the fast-path.
// v42 (events_fts self-heal): events_fts was the one FTS table outside ensureFTS's
// column-aware recreation (its DDL is non-standard — UNINDEXED cols + custom tokenizer +
// events_fts_* trigger names — so it can't use the generic ensureFTS). Adds a dedicated
// ensureEventsFTS run in the migration body so a future events column addition self-heals
// instead of leaving a stale narrow index whose (wider) triggers throw "no column" and
// silently drop event writes. NO new column, so LATEST_MIGRATION_COLUMN is unchanged — the
// forced pass alone carries it (same pattern as v35/v36/v38/v39/v40); existing DBs run it
// because version 41 != 42 falls through the fast-path.
// v43 (D#78 edge attribution): adds 4 columns to observation_files so each
// (obs, file) trigger edge carries its own injection/citation record —
// inject_count, miss_streak, last_resolved_session_id, last_cited_session_id.
// Per-EDGE policy, deliberately separate from the per-obs decay counters on
// observations (#8641: the two encode different policies — an edge that stops
// firing must not bury the lesson on other surfaces). The ALTERs live NEXT TO
// the observation_files CREATE (initSchema body), NOT in MIGRATIONS[] — that
// array runs before the table exists on fresh DBs.
// v44 (D#78 P3 scope label): observations.scope (file|module|project|
// environment, NULL for legacy/manual rows) — where a lesson APPLIES,
// decoupled from which files the episode touched. SEPARATE version from v43
// on purpose: dev-mode hooks migrate the live DB between working-tree edits,
// and a two-table batch under ONE version left a real DB at "43 with edge
// columns, without scope" that the single sentinel could not detect (observed
// 2026-07-14 on this machine's own DB). One version per migration batch keeps
// the version number itself the detector. LATEST_MIGRATION_COLUMN advances to
// observations.scope.
// v45 (per-surface funnel): citation_surface_log — the same invocation→cite
// funnel as citation_log (v38) but split by INJECTION FACE. citation_log answers
// "is effectiveness rising or falling" for a project; it cannot answer "which
// face is burning the budget", because hook.mjs unions all four
// query-conditioned faces (pre-tool-recall / UserPromptSubmit <memory-context> /
// PostToolUse error-recall / user-prompt-search FYI) before anything is
// recorded. Without per-face cite-rate there is no evidence to aim any
// precision lever at, which is what gated D#44 and D#129's remaining legs.
// The two tables are NOT comparable in either direction and the readers say so
// out loud: an obs carried by two faces is counted in both rows (pushes the
// surface sum UP), while cite-back signals join citation_log's denominator
// without belonging to any face and without the mainOnly filter (pushes the
// aggregate UP). Neither is a partition of the other.
// Keyed on the CC session id, NOT the memory session id — see the DDL comment.
// The column was renamed memory_session_id -> session_id BEFORE v45 ever
// shipped (pre-tag review), so no released database carries the old shape and
// no rename migration exists; the sentinel stays on `surface`, which is a
// table-presence check either way.
// New TABLE (not a column) reached via CORE_SCHEMA's CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
// on the forced migration pass. UNLIKE v38/v39 this DOES register a sentinel
// (citation_surface_log.surface) in LATEST_MIGRATION_COLUMNS: a table that only
// the forced pass can create is unreachable forever once the version row says
// "done", which is not a hypothetical — see the note there.
// v47: two additive indexes (P2-11 + ALGO-7). The bump is LOAD-BEARING, not bookkeeping:
// `initSchema`'s fast path returns before the `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` block, so on
// every existing install at v46 a new index there would simply never be created. Same trap
// the FTS5 migration hit — a DDL change that is not reachable from the version the DB
// already reports is a no-op with a convincing diff.
// v48 (R11-B-P1-1): observations.last_access_session_id — the THIRD per-row session key
// on this table, and it exists for the same reason as the other two. `Stop` fires once
// per assistant TURN and rescans the whole transcript, so `bumpCitationAccess` re-credited
// one citation on every later turn of the same session: real-corpus replay over 51
// transcripts read 338 credits across 43 distinct (session, id) pairs = 7.86x, single
// session worst case 18.75x. That feeds boostAccessed (access_count > 3 → importance + 1,
// in DEFAULT_MAINTAIN_OPS, unattended daily) and suppresses noisePenaltyClause, whose
// predicate reads `injection_count > access_count * 3`. Additive + nullable: legacy rows
// read NULL and are credited exactly once more, on their next citation, then stamp.
// The column holds the LAST crediting session, not a set, so two same-project sessions
// interleaving their turns flip it between them — see the scope note in bumpCitationAccess.
