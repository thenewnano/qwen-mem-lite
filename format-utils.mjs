 * Collapse a value to ONE line: newlines to spaces, then trim. Non-strings and nullish
 * become ''.
 *
 * Named and exported because it is a PRECONDITION two other transforms silently relied on
 * `truncate` to provide, and both broke when they were reordered around it:
 *
 * - `scrubSecrets` — three SECRET_PATTERNS arms carry the prose-position lookbehind
 *   `(?<![A-Za-z][ \t])`, whose class is HORIZONTAL whitespace on purpose. A credential
 *   noun at the start of a line therefore reads as CONFIG position to raw text and as PROSE
 *   position to collapsed text, and the config arm redacts any 6+ char value. Scrubbing
 *   before truncating (2026-09-21) fed it raw newlines and reinstated a corruption
 *   secret-scrub.mjs:45-57 records as deliberately undone: `"Reset the\npassword:
 *   instructions are in the onboarding doc"` stored as `password: *** are in…`, irreversibly.
 *   Measured 2026-09-22 on a 90-cell grid (6 credential nouns x 5 previous-line endings x 3
 *   value shapes): 12 cells over-redact and 0 leak. The COUNT is grid-dependent and is
 *   stated here once with its population rather than repeated elsewhere — the pre-ship lens
 *   read 9 on a 90-cell grid of the same shape with different value fixtures. What does not
 *   move between grids: every affected cell needs the previous line to end in a LETTER, the
 *   direction is uniformly over-redaction rather than leakage, and with this normalization
 *   restored all 90 cells are byte-identical to the pre-reorder output.
 * - single-line RENDER sites — a `\n` inside an interpolated value starts a new line in the
 *   assembled block, so any `## ` after it is a real heading rather than mid-line noise.
 *
 * So: any site that scrubs-then-truncates, or that interpolates free text into one line of a
 * markdown block, normalizes HERE first. `truncate` calls it, which is what kept the two
 * behaviours coupled while nothing named the coupling.

// Two delimiter classes are defanged here:
//   1. The blocks qwen-mem-lite wraps injected context in (qwen-mem-context / claude-mem-context /
//      memory-context / session-handoff). User-derived text containing one LITERALLY
//      would prematurely open/close the block it lands in, spilling the rest as
//      undelimited context.
//   2. Harness-authority + tool-call tags the runtime injects (system-reminder /
//      task-notification / function_calls / function_results, the latter two also in
//      their antml:-namespaced form). Memory replays arbitrary captured text \u2014 file
//      contents, tool output, web pages \u2014 so a poisoned observation carrying a literal
//      <system-reminder>\u2026</system-reminder> or a forged <function_calls>\u2026</function_calls>
//      block would smuggle a privileged-channel instruction / fake tool-call narrative
//      into the model's context. It can't escape its wrapper (class 1 closers are
//      defanged), but a nested forged authority/tool tag is still an indirect-prompt-
//      injection vector; strip the brackets so it reads as inert text. Tool-call tags
//      (<invoke \u2026>/<parameter \u2026>, bare + antml:-namespaced) are included: a prior turn's
//      malformed tool-XML replayed through a handoff corrupted the continuation surface
//      (mid-token truncation + model confusion), so replayed tool-XML must defang too.
//      These carry attributes, so the match allows an optional attribute tail before the
//      closing `>` \u2014 which also catches an attribute-bearing forgery of an authority tag
//      (<system-reminder foo="\u2026">). Unrelated tags (<other-tag>) are left intact.
// Reachable by editing files that contain these tokens \u2014 e.g. developing qwen-mem-lite
