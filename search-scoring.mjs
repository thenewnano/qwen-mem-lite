/**
 * Boost importance to 2 for observations that have been accessed multiple times
 * (access_count >= 2) but still have default importance (1).
 * Called after incrementing access_count in mem_get.
 *
 * A PROMOTER OUTSIDE THE MAINTENANCE RUN. `lib/maintain-core.mjs`'s DEFAULT_MAINTAIN_OPS
 * docblock records `boostAccessed` and `demotePinned` as opponents, and names TWO separate
 * defects it closed — keep them apart: the automatic path promoted and never demoted
 * because `demote_pinned` was in nobody's default set and hook.mjs did not import it, while
 * the two faces that DID wire the op ran it in opposite orders. The 148/148 figure quoted
 * there is rows sitting back at importance>=3 that were BOOST-ELIGIBLE, not rows this op
 * would have moved — CHANGELOG.md narrows the reachable-by-demotePinned count to 7.
 *
 * Both of those fixes act INSIDE a maintenance run. This function fires from
 * `fetchObsDetail`, so it is a promoter neither a default-set nor an ordering fix can reach:
 * every `get` / `mem_get` was another chance to hand the row straight back — the same
 * sentence that docblock uses for the bug it closed.
 *
 * Reproduced end-to-end before this clause: `maintain execute --ops demote_pinned` floors a
 * pinned-but-uncited row 2 -> 1, and ONE subsequent `get` returned it to 2. So an op in the
 * default maintain set (`lib/maintain-core.mjs` DEFAULT_MAINTAIN_OPS) had an effect any read
 * reverted, on its own target population.
 *
 * Population, stated rather than implied (doctrine rule 3): on the maintainer's DB sampled
 * 2026-09-14T20:14:16Z, 67 live rows, 3 pinned-but-uncited, and 0 of those had reached
 * access_count >= 2 — `injection_count` does not bump `access_count`, so the overlap needs
 * two explicit reads and was unrealised there. The mechanism is deterministic; the observed
 * incidence on that corpus is zero, and this is a snapshot of one corpus, not a property.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT FIX. `importance = 1` is also what an explicit
 * `claude-mem-lite update N --importance 1` writes, and that demotion is reverted by the
 * next read exactly the same way — worse, INSPECTING the row is what pushes access_count to
 * 2 in the first place. Separating "1 because nobody set it" from "1 because a human said
 * so" needs a marker this schema does not have, and `demoted_at` is not it — for a reason
 * the first draft of this paragraph got wrong, so it is stated precisely: nothing keys on
 * `demoted_at IS NULL` (the sole non-test reader, `mem-cli.mjs`'s decay-queue report, keys
 * on IS NOT NULL), so a write here would not evict anything — it would ADD the row to that
 * report, and `applyCitationDecay` CLEARS the column on the row's first citation, silently
 * discarding a human's demotion. Wrong owner, wrong lifetime. Left as a design decision
 * rather than patched around.
 *
 * THE EXCLUSION IS demotePinned's FLOOR, NOT ITS TRIGGER. `PINNED_FLOOR_SQL` in
 * lib/maintain-core.mjs is `CASE WHEN <no lesson> THEN 1 ELSE 2 END`, so a LESSON-BEARING
 * pinned row is floored at 2 and boosting it 1 -> 2 lands it exactly on that floor. The
 * first cut of this clause copied the trigger (`inj >= N AND cited = 0`) without the floor
 * and stranded those rows at 1, below the bound maintain-core declares for them — and 16 of
 * the 17 rows that op would have moved on the maintainer's DB were lesson-bearing. The
 * predicate below must keep selecting exactly the rows demotePinned would floor to 1.
 *
 * The no-lesson clause is COPIED rather than imported: `NO_LESSON_SQL` and `PINNED_FLOOR_SQL`
 * are module-private in maintain-core by an explicit decision recorded there ("exporting by
 * habit is how the knip baseline drifts"), and five verbatim copies already live in that
 * file. The prose stays out here in the docblock rather than inside the SQL string, because
 * a backtick in a template literal ends it — that cost one parse error on this very edit.
