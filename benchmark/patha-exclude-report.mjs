// benchmark/patha-exclude-report.mjs — the reader for D#216's meter.
//
// `lib/patha-exclude-meter.mjs` shipped with no consumer: nothing under mem-cli, lib,
// benchmark or scripts filtered on the `patha_exclude` event, so `aggregateMetrics`
// showed `n=…` with no latency and every column had to be unpicked from raw JSONL by
// hand (the defer's NICE-11). Rows were already accumulating. This closes that half —
// it does not decide D#216, it makes D#216 decidable.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a replay and it takes no measurement of its own: the two
// arms ran at the read, in one process against one database state, and this file only
// reads what they wrote. Every caliber question was settled there; the only ones left
// here are about how rows are POOLED, and there are three, each of which would otherwise
// produce a number that looks measured and is not:
//
//   1. THE SCHEMA CHANGED MID-STREAM. Rows written before the pre-tag B5 fix carry no
//      `markerCoercibleStrings` key, and their `inert` was computed on the rule that
//      version got wrong ("any string in the marker"), which counts a `P`/`D`/`E`-only
//      marker — a prompt with nothing excludable — as an inert exclude. Those rows are
//      not comparable with post-fix ones and cannot be recomputed, because the marker
//      ids themselves are not in the row. They get their own bucket and leave the
//      regime denominator. Detected on the ABSENCE of the key, not on any value.
//
//   2. `armB: 'error'` ROWS CARRY NO `net` AND NO `setChanged`. The meter leaves them
//      undefined on purpose, so that a failed arm cannot be read as "the repair changed
//      nothing" — a failure mode this repo has shipped. A reader that `?? 0`s them puts
//      the defect back. Only `armB === 'ok'` rows enter the measured population here.
//
//   3. A ZERO IN `suppressed` IS A FACT ABOUT THE SAMPLE. The defect's population is
//      prompts whose exclude was inert; on a corpus where that never happened, zero
//      suppression is not evidence the repair is harmless — it is evidence nothing was
//      observed. That is the `NO-POPULATION` verdict, kept distinct from `DECIDABLE`.
//
// WHICH COLUMN DECIDES. `refilled`, not `suppressed`. The ledger's open question is
// whether a slot freed by a working exclude gets refilled from the pool or is simply
// lost; a suppression count alone cannot answer it, and `net` alone cannot either
// (a one-for-one replacement is net zero while the delivered SET moved).
//
// This file reads no repo source as text, so it needs no path construction of its own —
// but the D#207 rule still applies to anything added later: build paths with join(), never
// `new URL('../X.mjs', import.meta.url)`, which drops the named module out of knip's
// unused-export report entirely.
