/**
 * EPISODE-FLUSH LIVE REPLAY — the ruler for D#178.
 *
 * THE CLAIM UNDER TEST. `flushEpisodeWithDb` consumes `reads-<project>.txt`
 * unconditionally (rename → read → unlink) while `flushEpisodeGroup` persists only
 * when `explainSignificance` says the episode is significant. So every insignificant
 * flush destroys whatever Read paths accumulated since the last flush, and the next
 * observation that IS saved carries `files_read: []`. D#174 confirmed the mechanism
 * with a probe; what nobody had was the MAGNITUDE, and the forward meter added in the
 * same round (`episode_reads`) only starts accruing from the day it ships.
 *
 * This script gets the number today, from data that already exists. There is no
 * fixture: the input is every real tool call in `~/.claude/projects/**.jsonl`, and the
 * batching is the SHIPPED batching — `isRelatedToEpisode`, `EPISODE_BUFFER_SIZE`,
 * `EPISODE_TIME_GAP_MS`, `planEpisodeFlush`, `explainSignificance` are imported, never
 * re-implemented. A copy of the flush rule here would be a twin of production and the
 * first thing to drift; this project has paid for that shape enough times.
 *
 *   node benchmark/episode-flush-replay.mjs                  # replay + report
 *   node benchmark/episode-flush-replay.mjs --since 2026-08-22
 *   node benchmark/episode-flush-replay.mjs --project projects--mem
 *   node benchmark/episode-flush-replay.mjs --json
 *
 * WHAT IT REPORTS. Per flush: how many distinct Read paths it consumed and whether any
 * of its sub-episodes was significant. Headline = the share of consumed reads destroyed
 * by insignificant flushes. Counterfactual = what the carry-forward fix (D#178 (b), and
 * (a) resolves to the same attachment) would put back, plus the AGE of the reads it
 * would carry — because "is a 40-minute-old Read still about this edit" is the open
 * question in that fix, and an unmeasured answer to it is how a fix ships worse than
 * the defect.
 *
 * THREE SELF-CHECKS, and the middle one is the only one with teeth against the model
 * itself:
 *   1. can-say-no — re-run the accounting with significance forced all-true and
 *      all-false; destroyed must be 0 and 100%. A ruler whose headline cannot reach
 *      either end is measuring its own constant.
 *   2. meter agreement — the live `episode_significance` rows are a DIRECT measurement
 *      of the quantity this replay models (share of flushes that are insignificant).
 *      Over the days both cover they must agree within MODEL_TOLERANCE_PP; they do not
 *      have to agree exactly (this walk skips `subagents/*.jsonl`, so it sees fewer
 *      tool calls than the hook did), but a structural break in the flush model shows
 *      up here and exits 1.
 *   3. corpus reachability — a project with transcripts but zero replayed flushes means
 *      the event extraction broke, not that the project was idle.
 *
 * KNOWN UNDER-COUNT, stated rather than silently absorbed: subagent transcripts live in
 * `<session>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl` and this walk is one level deep, so tool calls made
 * inside a dispatched agent — which DO fire PostToolUse and DO append to the same
 * project's reads file — are missing from the input. That biases both the flush count
 * and the reads count DOWN, in the same direction, and is the main reason check 2 is a
 * band rather than an equality.
