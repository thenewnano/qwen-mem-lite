// benchmark/rerank-pool-replay.mjs — the ruler for the `fyi` face's candidate-pool bounds
// (RERANK_POOL_SAME_PROJECT / RERANK_POOL_CROSS_PROJECT in hook-memory.mjs, audit ALGO-3).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AS A COMMITTED FILE. v3.85.0's first draft published five live-corpus
// numbers from a scratch script that was never committed, and the pre-tag claims review
// could not reproduce any of them. It turned out the harness was right and the SAMPLE
// PREDICATE was the whole difference — the draft sampled `LENGTH(prompt_text) BETWEEN 20
// AND 2000`, the reviewer sampled unfiltered, and on this corpus 1200-row samples of the
// same table span 11.9%–20.2% depending on which predicate you pick. A number nobody else
// can re-derive is not evidence, and a number whose sample predicate is a free parameter
// is barely better. Hence: DEFAULT IS THE WHOLE CORPUS, no sampling decision at all, and
// `--sample N` prints a warning saying so.
//
// WHAT IT MEASURES. `searchRelevantMemories` takes its candidate pool with
// `ORDER BY <raw bm25> LIMIT n` and then picks what to inject with a JS composite spanning
// 281× (type × lesson × importance × cross × OR × noise × cite). The LIMIT is therefore a
// REACHABILITY bound, not a ranking bound — D#172's shape. This replays every real user
// prompt through BOTH the shipped module and a twin with the pre-v3.85.0 pool values, and
// reports how often the injected set differs.
//
// USAGE
//   node benchmark/rerank-pool-replay.mjs                  whole corpus (the quotable number)
//   node benchmark/rerank-pool-replay.mjs --sample 1200    newest N prompts (a sampling decision)
//   node benchmark/rerank-pool-replay.mjs --baseline-same 10 --baseline-cross 5
//   node benchmark/rerank-pool-replay.mjs --cross-arm      cross-leg truncation rates only
//   node benchmark/rerank-pool-replay.mjs --cost           ms/prompt, both arms
//   node benchmark/rerank-pool-replay.mjs --json
//
// The default mode reports DELIVERED ROWS and a set-size histogram alongside the change
// rates. `MAX_MEMORY_INJECTIONS` is a per-set cap and the widening does not move it, but it
// does move the average FILL — quoting the unchanged cap without the delivered-row line
// reads as "no more rows are injected", which is not what happens.
//
// IT CANNOT POLLUTE WHAT IT MEASURES, and proves it rather than promising it — for BOTH
// sinks, which is the part this file got wrong until v3.91.0.
// (1) The corpus. `searchRelevantMemories` bumps `injection_count` on every row it returns
// — replaying it against the live DB would permanently move the very noise signal
// `noisePenaltyClause` reads, and arm A's bumps would change arm B's scores. The DB is
// opened `readonly`, so that UPDATE raises SQLITE_READONLY and is swallowed by the shipped
// line's own bare catch. `assertCannotWrite()` below executes the bump against the handle
// and FAILS THE RUN if it succeeds — a promise in a comment is not a guarantee.
// (2) The metrics. The same function also appends an `inject` row to
// `$DB_DIR/metrics/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`, and a readonly DATABASE handle does nothing about a
// file append. With QWEN_MEM_METRICS=1 a whole-corpus run wrote ~1.5M of them in a day
// against ~1.5k on a real day, and `doctor` then reported this replay's in-process timings
// as live injection latency. Every arm invocation now goes through `callArm()`, which
// passes the shipped `{ counterfactual: true }` option (it skips both side effects), and
// `assertNoMetricWrite()` proves the shard does not grow. Sentence (1) was true and read
// as if it covered the file; a guard is only as wide as the sinks it enumerates.

// D#190: until v3.86.0 nothing under tests/ imported this file, so every self-check
// described above could be deleted with a fully green suite — the same shape that let
// two of citation-live-replay.mjs's self-checks be removed from its main() undetected
// (v3.82.0). The checks are now exported and driven from tests/rerank-pool-replay.test.mjs
// with synthetic inputs, each one watched to FAIL. That is why they THROW rather than
// call process.exit: an exit code cannot be asserted in-process. main() catches and
// still exits 1 with the message on stderr, so the CLI contract is unchanged.

 * THE SECOND SINK, and the one `assertCannotWrite` above is structurally unable to see.

 * `searchRelevantMemories` writes twice per call: `UPDATE observations SET

 * `recordMetric(DB_DIR, { event: 'inject' })` (an appendFileSync to
 * `$DB_DIR/metrics/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`, which a readonly *database* handle does nothing
 * about). Until v3.91.0 this file replayed the whole corpus through both arms with the
 * metric sink wide open: on a machine running with QWEN_MEM_METRICS=1 that appended
 * ~1.5M `inject` rows in a day — three orders of magnitude over a production day — and
 * `qwen-mem-lite doctor` then reported the replay's in-process timings as if they were
 * live injection latency. The docblock at the top of this file said "IT CANNOT POLLUTE
 * THE CORPUS, and proves it rather than promising it"; that sentence was true of the
 * corpus and false of the metrics, because the proof only ever covered one sink.
 *
 * Liveness is why the throwaway dir exists. A guard that derives the shard filename
 * itself passes vacuously whenever the convention differs, and one that runs with the
 * sink disabled passes vacuously always — two of the three ways this check could look
 * green while seeing nothing. So: force the sink on, let `recordMetric` NAME the file in
 * a temp dir, and watch that same basename in the real one. Nothing is written to the
 * real dir to prove the detector works, because that would be the contamination it
 * exists to stop.
 *
 * The THIRD way is the probe call itself. `searchRelevantMemories` has three returns that
 * never call `_emit` — `!db || !userPrompt`, the length floor, and an empty FTS query. State
 * the invariant that way and not as "returns above the block": only the first two are
 * positionally above it, the third sits BELOW `_emit`'s definition inside the `try` and
 * simply never calls it, and the positional phrasing rots on any reorder. Either way a probe
 * on a two-word prompt writes nothing whatever the flag says, and the guard would certify a
 * sink it never approached. Hence `probe` must report whether it reached the emit path, and
 * a probe that did not fails the run rather than passing it. Returning rows is a SUFFICIENT
 * witness (that path emits), not a necessary one — the empty-result paths emit too — which
 * is the right direction for a guard.

 * THE RUN-LEVEL GUARD, and the reason the probe above is not enough on its own.
 *
 * `assertNoMetricWrite` proves that `callArm` is clean. That every arm invocation GOES
 * through `callArm` was left to a source-text case, and the pre-tag review broke it in four
 * ways the text cannot see — aliasing the handle (`const d = db; narrow(d, …)`),
 * `narrow.call(null, db, …)`, aliasing the function inside `costCompare`'s timer, and a
 * newly added exported helper that calls an arm directly. Each survived the suite, and the
 * aliasing one, replayed over 300 real prompts, **appended 992 metric rows while the run
 * exited 0 and printed a complete report** — this release's own defect, reopened through a
 * form the regex does not match. So the guarantee is re-stated at the level that matters:
 * not "the helper carries the flag" but "THIS RUN wrote nothing".
 *
 * It measures the whole `metrics/` DIRECTORY, not the one shard, which also closes the
 * UTC-day-rollover hole (a long run started at 23:59 writes into tomorrow's shard, and a
 * one-shard baseline would miss every row of it).
 *
 * Registered on `process.on('exit')` rather than called before each `process.exit(0)`: it
 * then covers every exit path including modes not yet written, and it runs AFTER the report
 * has printed, so a false positive — a live hook writing during a multi-minute run, which
 * this cannot distinguish and says so — costs a scary message rather than the run's output.
 *
 * One stated limitation: with `QWEN_MEM_METRICS` unset, a bypassing call writes nothing,
 * so this passes. That is correct (no harm occurred) but it means the run-level guard is
 * silent about call FORM on a metrics-off machine; the probe, which forces the sink on for
 * its own duration, is what covers that case. The two are complementary, not redundant.

/**
 * What the widening COSTS, measured rather than asserted. The docblock this ruler backs
 * used to say "a 3x widening chosen where cost stays flat", with a parenthetical stating
 * that the pool is the expensive term — i.e. its own reasoning predicted the opposite of
 * its claim, and the claims review measured +15.7%. A cost claim about our own work needs
 * a number and a command that reproduces it.
 *
 * Ordering bias is real here — the first arm to touch a page pays for the read — so the
 * two passes run the arms in OPPOSITE order and the per-arm totals are summed across both.
 * Without that, whichever arm goes first reads slower and the ratio is an artefact of the
 * loop, not of the pool size.
 *
 * READ THE RATIO AS A RANGE, NOT AS A VALUE, AND NEVER QUOTE THE ABSOLUTE ms. The v3.85.1
 * pre-tag review measured this five ways over fifteen whole-corpus runs. Holding the arm
 * order fixed reads 1.054–1.065; this design (alternating) reads 1.058–1.102 across six
 * runs on one machine; measuring each arm alone in its own process — the closest caliber to
 * production, where the function is called once per prompt minutes apart — reads
 * 1.063–1.156. So pairing the arms per prompt DOES let the second call reuse the first's
 * pages and alternating cancels only about half of it: this is the lowest-VARIANCE caliber,
 * not the unbiased one.
 *
 * Even so, its own spread is comparable to the effect it measures. Same code, same corpus,
 * an hour apart: 1.078 then 1.102, with ms/prompt moving 3.04 -> 1.80. So a three-digit
 * value from this function is not a fact about the pools, and the number in
 * hook-memory.mjs's docblock is deliberately a range.
 *
 * Both arms are timed for a prompt or neither is (review N7): the first draft incremented
 * the denominator after both calls, so a throw in the wide arm left the narrow arm's time
 * in the numerator with no matching denominator — a bias in the same direction as the
 * understatement above, tiny at 1 throw in 11289 but pointing the wrong way.
