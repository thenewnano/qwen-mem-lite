// benchmark/cutoff-reach-probe.mjs — what PreToolUse recall's 60-day cut removes (proposal B3).
//
// scripts/pre-tool-recall.js drops every observation and event created before
// `now - PRETOOL_LOOKBACK_MS`, whatever happened to it since. The OSS landscape review
// (docs/audits/20260927-oss-landscape-optimization-proposal.md, B3) proposes timing that cut
// from a row's last USE instead. This probe answers the prior question — does the cut remove
// anything that is still in use — and it has to be ready before the cut first bites
// (2026-11-04 on the maintainer DB, whose oldest live row is 2026-09-05).
//
// POPULATION (doctrine rule 3), per source: recall's importance and liveness predicates with
// the age predicate inverted. NOT recall's full WHERE — the lesson/type fallback, the scope
// and edge-decay flags and the per-file match are left out, because the question is about
// every lesson the cut can ever hide, not one file's query:
//   • observations: file-edged (observation_files), importance >= 2, liveObsFilterSql, and
//     created_at_epoch <= cutoff. Each (obs, file) EDGE is one row, because recall fires per
//     file. Split by the edge's own record (lib/edge-attribution.mjs): `cited` (a hit stamps
//     last_cited_session_id, which is never cleared — so EVER cited; `citedThenMissed` counts
//     those passed over since, miss_streak > 0), `missed`
//     (injected and resolved, never cited), and `neverInjected` (inject_count = 0 — nothing is
//     known about its use). `cited` is the closest this data gets to "in use"; a first
//     draft also counted `miss_streak = 0`, which without a cite means never resolved at all.
//   • events: importance >= 2, not superseded, carrying file_paths, created_at_epoch <= cutoff.
//     Events keep no per-file use record, so they are counted, not split.
//
// PREMISE the proposal got wrong, stated so nobody re-derives it: "expiry is miss_streak's
// job" holds only with QWEN_MEM_EDGE_DECAY on, which is OFF by default. What does retire
// file lessons on a stock install, besides this cut: supersede, compress, and the daily
// `decay` maintain op, which lowers importance by one on rows older than 30 days whose
// injection_count AND access_count are both 0 (lib/maintain-core.mjs). PreToolUse recall
// updates neither counter, so an importance-2 observation that only file recall shows — never
// cited, searched or injected at prompt time — drops out of this pool at 30 days, before the
// cut. The cut is what reaches the rest: importance-3 rows and rows another face touched.
//
// Read-only: the database is opened { readonly: true } and nothing else is written.
