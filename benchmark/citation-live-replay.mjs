/**
 * citation LIVE REPLAY — every injection FACE's cite-rate, re-derived from real
 * transcripts through the SHIPPED extractors.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE THE TWO THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE IT.
 *
 *   `qwen-mem-lite citation-stats` reads `citation_surface_log`, a table written at
 *     Stop. That table is only as old as the METER, and the meter is routinely younger
 *     than the behaviour it measures. On 2026-08-25 it held n=8 over 2.1 days for
 *     `task_imperative` — which reads like "not enough data to decide" — while these
 *     same extractors run over the live corpus gave n=34, because the FLAG had been
 *     parked for weeks and the meter had only shipped in v3.76. A face is invisible
 *     there for as long as it predates its own accounting.
 *
 *   `benchmark/cite-recall.mjs` walks real transcripts, but routes ids into buckets
 *     with its OWN marker set (`[mem]`, `<memory-context`, a hand-copied imperative
 *     string) — a TWIN of lib/citation-tracker.mjs's SURFACE_MATCHERS, and the exact
 *     shape of duplication this project keeps paying for. Its buckets are hook-EVENT
 *     names rather than the `citation_surface_log.surface` labels every docblock and
 *     CLI quotes, so its rows cannot be compared to a published per-face number
 *     without a translation step; and its cited-side attribution is a per-session
 *     union, the caliber that credited `subagent` for cross-agent citations until
 *     v3.81.0. It stays for its per-hook baseline diff; new per-FACE questions belong
 *     here.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES. For each session: which observation ids each face put in front of
 * the model, and which of those the model then cited back as `#NN`. Both halves come
 * from production — `extractInjectedBySurface`, `extractCitationsFromTranscript`,
 * `collectSubagentSurface` — so a face added to SURFACE_MATCHERS appears here without
 * this file being touched, and the coverage assertion below fails loudly if one is
 * added that this script cannot reach.
 *
 * CALIBER, stated because two rounds of this project's history turn on it:
 *   denominator = (session, id) PAIRS. One observation counts ONCE per session per
 *     face however many times it was injected — the house unit, and the one
 *     `citation_surface_log` keys on (project, session, surface).
 *   numerator   = that id appearing as `#NN` in that session's own assistant text.
 *     For the five attachment faces that means MAIN-THREAD text (`mainOnly`), matching
 *     the citation-decay loop. For `subagent` it means the RECEIVING agent's own text:
 *     an id handed to agent A and mentioned by agent B is NOT a hit.
 *
 *   NEVER COMPARE TWO RUNS TAKEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES. The corpus grows every session,
 *   so subtracting yesterday's rate from today's attributes corpus growth to whatever
 *   shipped in between — an error made and caught on 2026-08-25 (a denominator read
 *   +38 across a flip that a same-corpus one-pass A/B put at +22). Use `--split <ISO>`,
 *   which cuts ONE walk over ONE snapshot into a before/after arm, or freeze the corpus
 *   with `--dump` and re-score it with `--corpus`.
 *
 *   node benchmark/citation-live-replay.mjs                     # every face, whole corpus
 *   node benchmark/citation-live-replay.mjs --split 2026-08-24  # before/after, ONE walk
 *   node benchmark/citation-live-replay.mjs --since 2026-08-01 --project mem
 *   node benchmark/citation-live-replay.mjs --dump c.json       # freeze the corpus
 *   node benchmark/citation-live-replay.mjs --corpus c.json     # re-score a frozen one
 *   node benchmark/citation-live-replay.mjs --by-project --json
 *
 * `--split` cuts on the session START timestamp (the first parsable one in the
 * transcript), so a session that began before the boundary and ran for hours after it
 * lands entirely in the `before` arm. That matters precisely because the flag exists to
 * attribute a delta to something that shipped at a point in time. `--project` is an
 * unanchored substring over the encoded directory name, so `--project mem` would also
 * select a `memo` project if one existed.

/**
 * D#179: of the hits that make up each face's numerator, how many were named in a
 * response that also DID something, and how many only in prose?
 *
 * This is the prerequisite the deferred item names — it sizes the contamination, it does
 * not fix it. `applyCitationDecay` promotes on any `#NN` in assistant text, so a release
 * note or an audit promotes every memory it discusses; the same signal feeds
 * citation_surface_log, citation-stats and this replay, so all three move together.
 *
 * NEITHER COLUMN IS A BOUND. `applied` over-counts, because naming an id in a response
 * that also calls a tool is co-occurrence and not evidence the lesson was followed.
 * `mentionOnly` also over-counts, because an agent that acts in one response and cites
 * the lesson in a later summary is classified pure-mention. The split sizes the
 * question; it does not settle it, and a first draft of this docblock called
 * `mentionOnly` a floor, which is wrong in the second direction.
 *
 * `subagent` is absent from the output BY CONSTRUCTION, not because it scored zero: its
 * hits come from the RECEIVING agent's own transcript via collectSubagentSurface, which
 * this classification does not walk. It is declared unavailable rather than omitted —
 * a missing row reads as "that face has no contamination", which is not what is known.
 *
 * Returns null when the records predate the `applied` field (a frozen corpus dumped
 * before this existed) — an absent field must not be reported as zero.

 * D#153's ruler. Break a face's (session,id) pairs down by the row attribute the SCOPE
 * lever keys on — `observations.scope` — and give each bucket its own cite-rate.
 *
 * WHY HERE AND NOT IN denoise-ab. The scope lever lives in scripts/pre-tool-recall.js,
 * which denoise-ab does not execute at all (its own SCOPE docblock says so): editing a
 * scope filter and re-running that harness reports NEUTRAL Δ=0 by construction. A
 * scope-mixed FIXTURE suite there would have produced a number about a corpus somebody
 * authored, which on this surface has twice reported the opposite of the live DB. The
 * question D#153 actually asks — "are environment-scoped rows less relevant ON THE
 * FILE-TRIGGERED FACE" — has a direct answer in real data: that face is `pretool`, and
 * this walk already holds every id it injected and every id the model then cited.
 *
 * Two caliber notes that decide how to read the table:
 *   • an id whose row is gone from the DB (compressed, deleted, merged) buckets as
 *     `(gone)` rather than being dropped, because dropping it would shrink a denominator
 *     silently and the scope buckets would no longer sum to the face's own pair count.
 *   • `(null)` is legacy/manual rows that never went through enrich-time labelling. It is
 *     a real bucket with real behaviour, not missing data to be excluded.
