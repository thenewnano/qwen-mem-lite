// benchmark/keyctx-pool-replay.mjs — the ruler for the SessionStart Key Context face's
// candidate-pool bounds (KEYCTX_POOL_OBS / KEYCTX_POOL_SESS in hook-context.mjs, D#192 —
// filed as D#189, re-scoped to obs-only after this ruler measured the two bounds apart).
//
// WHY IT IS ITS OWN FILE. This is the FIFTH surface of the D#172 shape — a SQL LIMIT
// sitting upstream of a JS relevance filter, so the LIMIT bounds REACHABILITY, not
// ranking. It is also the purest instance found so far: `rerank-pool-replay`'s face at
// least orders its pool by raw bm25, one factor of the final composite. Here both
// SELECTs order by `created_at_epoch DESC` alone, while the selector re-sorts by
// `valueDensity` = recency x typeQuality x impBoost x lessonBoost / sqrt(cost). Recency
// enters that product compressed into (1,2] by `1.0 + exp(...)`, against impBoost
// alone spanning 1.0-2.0 and typeQuality and lessonBoost multiplying on top — so the
// key the SQL sorts on is close to irrelevant to the final order.
//
// NOTHING ELSE CAN SEE THIS FACE. `benchmark/denoise-ab.mjs` drives search-engine.mjs
// (query -> document FTS); `rerank-pool-replay` drives hook-memory.mjs;
// `imperative-pool-replay` drives the identifier-overlap face. None of them imports
// hook-context.mjs, so a NEUTRAL verdict from any of them says nothing at all here.
//
// ITS ABSOLUTE NUMBERS ARE SNAPSHOTS. THE COMPARISON BETWEEN ARMS IS NOT.
// `selectWithTokenBudget` takes no clock: it calls `Date.now()`, derives adaptive time
// windows from it, and weights every candidate by recency. So a token count, a
// gained/displaced count, or a set size printed here is a fact about THIS MACHINE AT THIS
// MINUTE — v3.86.0 published `829 -> 1880` and `9 gained / 2 displaced` from this file,
// and hours later the same commands read `652 -> 1863` and `10 gained / 3 displaced`.
//
// AND NOT BECAUSE THE CORPUS GREW — that was the first, half-right diagnosis. The pools
// are SLIDING WINDOWS, so they DECAY with wall-clock even while the store gains rows.
// Measured on `projects--mem` the same evening: obsPool 113 -> 112 -> 108 across three
// runs while its live row count went 776 -> 777 with zero rows superseded. Growth cannot
// lower a count; a receding window can. The pre-tag claims review caught the drift and
// supplied this mechanism; the numbers were republished with a timestamp.
//
// What IS stable is the DIRECTION, because both arms run in one process microseconds
// apart against one database: which arm changes the observation selection, which one only
// adds summaries, and the sign and rough size of the token cost. Quote those. If you must
// quote an absolute, stamp it with the date and say it is a snapshot.
//
// THE UNIT IS A PROJECT, NOT A PROMPT, and that is the honest limitation. Key Context
// takes no query — it is (db, project, budget) — so the corpus is however many projects
// this machine has, and n is around a dozen. Read the per-project table, not the
// aggregate; a percentage over n=12 is a count wearing a disguise.
//
// SELECTION HERE IS NOT MONOTONE, and this ruler must not borrow rerank-pool-replay's
// superset argument. TWO stages downstream of the pool can DROP a row that a narrower
// pool would have selected, and `--why-displaced` says which, per row, instead of
// leaving the reader to assume:
//   • the type-diversity cap (max 3 per type) — the only live gate on this corpus;
//   • the token budget — does not bind here (651 of 2000 in the widest arm's largest
//     project), so a displacement attributed to it would be a surprise worth checking.
// There was a third, the file-overlap penalty, and D#197 deleted it rather than
// leaving it listed as a gate that never fires: its `continue` needed
// valueDensity < 0.001/0.7 against an analytic floor of 0.5 for `value` (a title
// costing >122k tokens; the live minimum measured 0.1147, 80x above the trigger), and
// the penalty it computed was never read by the ordering anyway.
// So `displaced` is expected to be non-zero and is reported as a first-class number
// rather than gated to zero. What IS gated: the ruler must be able to SEE displacement
// at all (a self-check drives a synthetic case and requires a non-zero count), and
// shipped-vs-shipped must report no difference.
//
// AN ARM CAN BE INERT WITHOUT BEING EQUAL. `writeTwin` throws only when BOTH bounds match
// shipped, so after v3.87.0 raised OBS to 200 the default invocation (200/10 vs 200/40)
// runs an obs arm that is identical by construction and reports `obs newly reachable: 0`
// with nothing to flag it — a reader takes that for "widening obs does nothing". Worse,
// any bound at or above the largest pool is the same arm as any other: 200 and 500 are
// indistinguishable here. Every mode that COMPARES two arms — the default replay,
// --why-displaced and --cost — prints an INERT notice when the twin equals shipped or when
// both bounds sit above the largest pool; --population takes no second arm and instead
// prints the largest pool outright. A null result and a comparison that could not have
// produced a non-null result are not the same finding.
//
// The notice is itself checked, because an annotation nothing can falsify is worse than
// none: mutating the pool-size input to 0 once made every run print INERT directly above a
// report showing two projects changing, with the whole suite green. assertInertConsistent
// throws on that contradiction, and main() refuses to start if any project cleared the row
// floor while the largest pool measured 0.
