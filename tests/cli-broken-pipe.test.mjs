// A reader that leaves is not an error.
//
// `qwen-mem-lite search x | head -1`, `| grep -q`, or quitting `less` closes the read end
// while the CLI is still writing. Node then emits 'error' on the stdout Socket, and with no
// listener that is an UNHANDLED error event: a ~20-line stack ending in `outVerbatim` where
// the user expected their prompt back.
//
// NOT every command, measured rather than generalised (20 trials each, pre-fix, `| head -1`):
// `search` / `export` / `recent` / `stats` / `doctor` / `timeline` / `citation-stats` 20/20,
// `browse` 19/20, and `help` / `status` / `context` / `get` / `memdir-audit` 0/20. What
// decides it is whether a write is still pending when the reader goes — a function of how
// many lines the consumer takes and how the output is batched, NOT of the 64 KB pipe buffer:
// pre-ship review found `stats` crashing at `head -20` on an output far under that buffer
// (its size is corpus dependent, so no byte count is quoted). An earlier draft of this
// header said "every stdout-bearing command" and blamed the buffer; both were wrong, and
// the pre-ship claims lens measured them.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE CAN AND CANNOT SAY NO ABOUT — stated because the first draft shipped an arm
// that could not, and it looked identical to one that could.
//
// The fix is one listener in `cli.mjs`, the published `bin`, rather than at
// `cli/common.mjs`'s `out()` chokepoint. The reason is a claim about population: `doctor`
// writes through `console.log` inside `install.mjs` and never passes through
// `cli/common.mjs`, so a chokepoint fix would have covered the mem-cli half and left the
// installer half loud. That claim is MEASURED, outside this suite, against a
// listener-removed mutant of cli.mjs: `doctor | head -1` crashed 10/10 with the stack ending
// `console.log → ok()` inside install.mjs, and 0/10 with the listener restored. (Named by
// function, not by line: a line number in a file this diff also edits is stale on arrival.)
//
// It is measured outside the suite because it cannot be measured inside it. In a vitest
// worker the same spawn reads `epipe=false, outLen=0, errLen=0` on the MUTANT, against
// `epipe=true` standalone — reproducible in both directions. WHY is not established: the
// obvious explanation (the write fails synchronously in-worker and `console.log`'s
// `ignoreErrors: true` swallows it) was probed directly by the pre-ship claims lens and did
// NOT hold — that probe read sync=false / async=EPIPE in both contexts. So the reading is
// the finding and the mechanism is open; do not repeat the swallowed-sync story as if it
// were settled. Either way a `doctor` arm here would be GREEN on a build with no listener at
// all — a structurally blind ruler, whose NEUTRAL says nothing. The shell-pipe shape is blind
// in-suite too (0/5 on the mutant for BOTH commands). The only in-suite shape that
// discriminates is closing the read end immediately after spawn, and only on the mem-cli
// route.
//
// So the installer route is pinned by the source arm below rather than behaviourally: it
// fails if the listener is moved, narrowed, or turned into a swallow, which is the whole set
// of edits that would re-open the install.mjs half.
//
// Two further shapes are recorded so the next edit does not reach for them: `status` never
// reaches a failing write in any shape (0/10 on the mutant), and `search` on an EMPTY data
// dir emits one line, so `| head -1` consumes all of it and nothing ever writes to a closed
// pipe. A guard built on either would be vacuous and would look exactly like this one.
