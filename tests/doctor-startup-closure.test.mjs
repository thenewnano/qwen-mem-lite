// doctor's STARTUP surface, driven as a subprocess against a copy install.
//
// Audit 2026-09-08 (P1-1). Four rounds listed doctor as "next round's scope" and never
// ran it; when it finally was, the finding was not in its verdicts — those hold — but in
// whether it starts at all. install.mjs pulled `lib/db-unusable.mjs` through a STATIC
// import, and that one edge dragged the whole retrieval/NLP subtree (utils → nlp,
// synonyms, stop-words, scoring-sql, …) into doctor's load graph. Its only consumer is
// `dbCheckRemedy`, which runs inside a catch. So a copy install missing any one of those
// files — a half-finished update, a trimmed tarball (this repo has shipped three), a user
// deleting a file — got a bare ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND stack from the one command whose job
// is to say "this file is missing, run repair".
//
// This is CLAUDE.md's "a recovery path must not import the thing it recovers", recurring
// on a different edge: last time it was two path constants, this time it is a remedy
// string builder.
//
// The closure is asserted BEHAVIOURALLY (does doctor speak?) rather than by counting
// modules: a count is a smoke alarm, and a count-based pin would go green the moment
// someone re-exported the same subtree through a different edge.

// `await import()`. It is also the published `bin`. So it is the host, and these
