// `get D#<missing>` said "Deferred item(s) not found" twice, the second line a superset of
// the first.
//
// The two writers answer different questions and both are wanted. mem-cli.mjs's early
// stderr note names which D# ids missed while OTHER sections still render — a mixed request
// has to say that, because its output otherwise looks complete. The terminal `fail()` below
// it reports "nothing at all was found" and adds the `defer list` hint. They overlap on
// exactly one shape: a deferred-only request where nothing matched, which is what a user
// typing a stale `D#` id hits.
//
// So the guard has to pin BOTH directions. Suppressing the early note outright would be the
// obvious over-fix and would silence the mixed case, which is the one that needs it most.
