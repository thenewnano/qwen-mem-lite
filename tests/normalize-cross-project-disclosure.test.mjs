// The QWEN_MEM_NORMALIZE_CROSS_PROJECT escape hatch must be DISCOVERABLE on the path
// where it actually changes behaviour — and stderr is not that path.
//
// History, because this is the second repair of the same defect and the first one looked
// exactly like a fix. R10-P3-21's second review found the hatch's warning going through
// `debugLog`, which returns early unless QWEN_MEM_DEBUG is set — so it fired zero times
// in the detached worker that is the only place the hatch is used unattended. The repair
// swapped it for a bare `console.error`, and the test that certified the repair spied on
// `console.error` IN PROCESS. That proves the function emits. It does not prove anyone
// receives.
//
// It does not: `hook.mjs` reaches this path via `spawnBackground('llm-optimize')`, and
// `hook-shared.mjs` spawns with `stdio: 'ignore'`, i.e. the child's fd 2 IS /dev/null.
// Removing the QWEN_MEM_DEBUG gate removed one of two blockers; the remaining one is
// sufficient on its own, so the warning still reached nobody on the unattended path.
//
// So the channel had to become one the detached worker does not own: `doctor`, which the
// USER runs in their own terminal. Same shape as install.mjs's QWEN_MEM_SKIP_SIG_VERIFY
// precedent — tell the operator a protection is switched off, on a surface they look at.
// The `console.error` stays and is still correct for the foreground CLI path
// (`qwen-mem-lite optimize --run --task normalize`), which is why it is not removed here.
