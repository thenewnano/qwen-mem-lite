// QA round 1 — an unpaired sentinel makes the managed-block regex span arbitrary user text,
// and `unadopt` reports success over a file it did not clean.
//
// The block is located by ONE non-greedy regex over the whole file:
//   <!-- slug:begin (v\d+) -->\r?\n([\s\S]*?)\r?\n<!-- slug:end -->
// `[\s\S]*?` happily spans a SECOND begin marker, so the matched region is not necessarily
// one block. Drop the end marker by hand (a merge resolution, an editor, another tool) and
// the next two adopts do this — measured 2026-09-13 on a sandbox project:
//
//   [1] adopt, then the user appends "## Deployment runbook / STEP ONE…"   STEP ONE: 1
//   [2] the `:end` line is deleted by hand                                  STEP ONE: 1
//   [3] adopt  -> appends a second block below the user's text              STEP ONE: 1
//       file is now: begin1 body1 <no end> …USER TEXT… begin2 body2 end2
//   [4] adopt  -> the regex matches begin1 …lazily… end2, which SPANS the
//       user's text and begin2, and `raw.replace(m[0], section)` deletes it  STEP ONE: 0
//
// Four damage shapes measured over 40 adopt iterations each, counting adopts AFTER the
// damage. Two never return to one well-formed block, one converges on the SECOND such adopt
// by DESTROYING the user's text, and one was already fine:
//   end deleted        unadopt "absent" | adopt begin=2/end=1 | 2nd adopt DELETES user text
//   begin deleted      unadopt "absent" | adopt begin=1/end=2 | never converges
//   version tag broken unadopt "absent" | adopt begin=2/end=2 | never converges, block twice
//   blank line added   unadopt "removed" — fine, the body pattern already allows it
//
// Two fixes, one root cause each:
//   (a) the body may not contain another sentinel, so a match is always exactly one block;
//   (b) removeManaged must not answer 'absent' when it deleted the sidecar files or left an
//       orphan sentinel behind. That report is what silenced the SINGLE-project `unadopt`.
//       The `--all` sweep is a different surface: it gates on hasResidue and never reached
//       an orphan-only project at all — and after pre-ship review P2-3 it deliberately still
//       does not, because a sentinel in prose is not evidence the plugin ever wrote there.
//
// The shipped block body carries no `slug:begin` / `slug:end` literal (measured: 1304 bytes —
// 1296 UTF-16 units — the slug appearing twice, never as a sentinel), so (a) cannot reject a
// legitimate block. A test now pins that property; it is what the tightened pattern rests on.
