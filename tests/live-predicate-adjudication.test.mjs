// The `COALESCE(compressed_into,0)=0` vs `liveObsFilterSql` decision, made enforceable.
//
// liveObsFilterSql is `COALESCE(compressed_into,0)=0 AND superseded_at IS NULL`. A site using
// the first half alone treats a superseded row as live. Whether that matters depends entirely
// on what the site DOES with the row, so the answer is per-site, and it has now been made for
// all 11 shipped sites (R8 §6-a, carried as open in R10 §7, judged 2026-09-06 — zero changes
// warranted). CLAUDE.md's "Invariants that bite" carries the reasoning.
//
// A decision recorded only in prose drifts. This file pins the POPULATION: which functions
// hold a bare predicate, and how many each holds. A new bare predicate in a new function reds
// here, which is the point — the author has to judge it and extend the map, rather than
// inheriting an exemption that was reasoned about someone else's code.
//
// It also pins the other direction: the writers that MUST carry the full predicate still do.
// A guard that only forbids is half a guard — removing liveObsFilterSql from the PENDING_PURGE
// writer is the data-loss shape the invariant exists to prevent, so it gets its own case.
