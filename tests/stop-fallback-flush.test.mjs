// Audit 2026-08-22 P2-9. handleStop has two ways to flush the episode buffer: the
// normal locked path, and — when another hook process holds the lock — a fallback that
// renames the buffer to claim it and saves from there. The fallback was a hand-copy of
// flushEpisodeGroup carrying three comments asserting parity with it, and it was not in
// parity. It now calls flushEpisodeGroup.
//
// Both differences the copy had are observable from outside, so they are tested from
// outside: a real `hook.mjs stop` subprocess with the lock already held by a live PID.
