# Sandbox install harness

Plays a **real user** through both documented install paths, end to end, against a
throwaway `$HOME`. Not part of `vitest run`: these drive real `npm pack` / `npm i -g`,
real `npm install` inside a fake plugin cache, and a real MCP server over stdio, so a
full pass takes minutes and needs network.

```bash
SBX_BASE=/tmp/claude/sbx node tests/sandbox/phaseA-plugin.mjs   # /plugin install …    47 checks
SBX_BASE=/tmp/claude/sbx node tests/sandbox/phaseB-npm.mjs      # npm i -g + install   56 checks
SBX_BASE=/tmp/claude/sbx node tests/sandbox/phaseC-update.mjs   # version swap         15 checks
```

Each exits non-zero if any check fails and prints a `PASS`/`FAIL` line per check. **The
counts above are also asserted** — each phase carries an `EXPECTED_CHECKS` constant and
`summary()` fails the run when the tally does not match. That is not tidiness: phase B's
whole self-heal section sat behind an `if (existsSync(bindingPath))` whose path went stale
with better-sqlite3 13, so eight checks silently stopped running and the only witness was a
run printing 37 where this file said 45 — a number nobody diffs. Change the constant when
you add or remove a check on purpose, never to quiet a mismatch.

**Never name the native addon's path.** `loadedBindingPath()` in `lib.mjs` asks
better-sqlite3's own `lib/binding.js` which file it would load; 12 compiled
`build/Release/better_sqlite3.node` and 13 ships `prebuilds/<platform>.node`, so the
literal both phases used to carry pointed at a file that no longer exists and the self-heal
checks were vacuous from v4.0.0 to v5.1.0.
Sandboxes are created under `SBX_BASE`, falling back to `$TMPDIR`, and are **left on
disk** so a failure can be inspected — delete them when you are done. Phase B alone
leaves ~50 MB (a real `npm i -g` tree).

**`SBX_BASE` is in every command above on purpose.** `os.tmpdir()` reads `$TMPDIR`, and
in a Claude Code session `$TMPDIR` is `~/.claude/tmp/claude-<uid>` — under `$HOME`,
which is exactly what the "Do not put the sandbox under `$HOME`" convention below
forbids, for the reason given there. That is not a hypothetical: on a machine where
`~/node_modules` holds `better-sqlite3` and `qwen-mem-lite`, the run measures the home
tree and passes. `tests/sandbox/sbx-base.mjs` now refuses such a base outright rather
than leaving the rule to a reader — `tests/sandbox-base-guard.test.mjs` drives the
refusal, and it is in `vitest run` even though the harness itself is not.

**Run them one at a time.** Chaining `phaseA … ; phaseB …` in a single shell crashed
phase B once, while phase B on its own passed 45/45 immediately after. Not attributed —
recorded here rather than left for the next person to rediscover.

## Why it exists

The v3.70.0 round found five defects that the 4500-test suite could not see, because
every one of them lived in the difference between install *shapes* rather than in a
function:

- a healthy plugin-only install reporting `3 issue(s) found` and exiting 1
- a stale `~/.qwen-mem-lite` binding reported as `✓ verified` while the registered
  MCP server FATAL'd and every hook silently no-op'd
- `SessionStart` emitting three separate writes on one stdout, so Claude Code parsed
  none of them as an envelope
- `PostToolUse` dropping both of its receipts when two co-fired
- `doctor` prescribing `qwen-mem-lite update`, which is the observation editor

The unit suite was green through all of it. What these scripts add is the *shape*: a
fake `$HOME`, a fake `claude` binary recording `claude mcp add/remove/list`, a plugin
cache populated the way Claude Code populates one (a git checkout, **no**
`node_modules`), and hooks fired with the real stdin payloads.

## What each phase covers

| Phase | Covers |
|---|---|
| A | marketplace add → cold `setup.sh` (real `npm install`) → all six hook events → MCP `initialize`/`tools/list`/`tools/call` → bundled CLI → auto-update in plugin mode → stale-ABI self-heal → uninstall residue |
| B | `npm pack` → `npm i -g` → `qwen-mem-lite install` → settings.json hooks actually firing → MCP from the managed install → `self-update` → self-heal with the CLI's own tree healthy and the managed one broken → **plugin-cache launch.mjs sync (R10-P2-11)** → **an in-place install under live hook traffic (R10-P2-12)** → `uninstall` and `--purge` |
| C | a new cache version dir arriving without `node_modules`, a hook firing from it before its deps exist, `setup.sh` provisioning it, memory surviving the version swap, cache pruning to the latest 3 |

## Conventions worth keeping

- **Inherit the ambient environment.** An early version used `env -i`, which dropped
  the proxy vars and made `npm install` fail with DNS errors — a harness failure that
  reads exactly like a product failure. `sandboxEnv()` clones `process.env` and strips
  only `CLAUDE_*` / `MEM_*`.
- **Do not put the sandbox under `$HOME`.** Node resolves `better-sqlite3` up the
  directory tree, so a sandbox nested under a home that owns `node_modules` silently
  resolves to it and the isolation is fake.
- **Give each fake root its own dependency tree.** Symlinking every root at the repo's
  `node_modules` collapses them under realpath dedup, and multi-root assertions then
  pass or fail for the wrong reason.
- **A control per destructive check.** Before asserting "doctor goes red", assert the
  thing is genuinely broken (the MCP server really fails to start) and that the tree
  doctor runs from is genuinely healthy — otherwise a red verdict proves nothing.
- **A premise check per SHAPE the section needs.** B9 and B10 each cost a run to learn
  this. B9's first version built a plugin cache and no marketplace clone, so the block it
  targets (`if (existsSync(pluginDir))`) never ran and the section reported "install left
  the old version alone" — the friendly answer, from code that had not executed. B10's
  first version logged **0 of 400** hook fires inside the install window and read as a
  clean run; two causes, both the probe's: `date +%s%3N` prints 19-digit nanoseconds on
  this machine (the width is ignored), so every comparison was false by arithmetic, and
  the loop's node cold start was longer than the 449 ms install it was supposed to
  overlap. A stress probe that did not overlap is not a negative result, it is no result —
  so both now assert the overlap and the shape before asserting the outcome.
