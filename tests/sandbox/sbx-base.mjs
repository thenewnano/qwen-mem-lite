// tests/sandbox/sbx-base.mjs — where a sandbox root is allowed to live.
//
// The README has carried this rule since v3.71.0:
//
//   "Do not put the sandbox under $HOME. Node resolves better-sqlite3 up the directory
//    tree, so a sandbox nested under a home that owns node_modules silently resolves to
//    it and the isolation is fake."
//
// …in its "Conventions worth keeping" section at the END of the file, some forty lines
// BELOW the sentence at the top that says sandboxes are created under `$TMPDIR`. That
// distance is part of why the rule did not bind: a reader of the quickstart never gets
// there. (A draft of this comment said "two paragraphs above", which is both the wrong
// direction and the wrong distance — the pre-tag claims review caught it in three files.)
// The two are the same sentence in a Claude Code session, where `$TMPDIR` is set to
// `~/.claude/tmp/claude-<uid>` — so the DOCUMENTED DEFAULT violates the documented rule,
// and it does so silently: `/home/<user>/node_modules` here holds both `better-sqlite3`
// and `qwen-mem-lite`, so every check still passes while measuring the wrong tree.
// Found by running the harness, not by reading it, which is the whole argument for
// running it.
//
// A README line would not have prevented this — the README already said it. So the
// refusal is in code, and it names the resolved path rather than the variable, because
// the variable is not what is wrong.
