// P2-13 (narrowed) — DAY_MS had four definitions and ~60 bare literals.
//
// The full P2-13 item was "audit every empty catch block"; 135 non-test sites
// would have become 135 rubber-stamp comments, so only this half was taken.
// The value here is not drift-prevention — 86_400_000 is a physical constant —
// it is that a window policy now greps as a NAME. `30 * DAY_MS` states the
// unit; `2592000000` makes every reader recompute it.
//
// Scope: runtime source only. tests/ and benchmark/ keep their local literals
// on purpose — a fixture saying `epochOffset: -60 * 86400000` is stating raw
// data, and rewriting ~200 assertion sites would be churn with no reader.
