// `doctor` is the command a user runs when something is wrong, and it was the only surface
// that never mentioned the three deeper modes exist.
//
// The two-doctor split is invisible from outside: `doctor` with no flags goes to install.mjs's
// health check, and `--benchmark` / `--metrics` / `--session-audit` are routed to
// cli/doctor.mjs by cli.mjs. On a clean sandbox the plain run prints a couple of dozen check
// lines and a count — the exact number depends on the sandbox's own state, so it is not quoted
// as a property — and the strings "benchmark", "metrics" and "session-audit" appeared nowhere
// in it. A user whose install is healthy but whose RETRIEVAL is bad reads "All checks passed!"
// and has no way to learn that a retrieval benchmark is one flag away.
//
// This is the cheap half of D6. The expensive half -- actually merging the two
// implementations -- is closed as won't-fix: the failure it would have prevented (a new mode
// added to cli/doctor.mjs and not to the router, silently answered by the install check) is
// now gated by tests/doctor-mode-router-sync.test.mjs, and "merging" either yields one
// 1100-line function or reproduces today's structure in one file.
//
// The pointer is asserted to be DERIVED from the router rather than typed, because a
// hand-written list of modes in a help string is the same rot the router guard exists for —
// one more copy to forget.
