// The README must not claim the FTS index stems, because it does not.
//
// `observations_fts` is created with no `tokenize=` clause, so FTS5 uses `unicode61`: a
// query term matches the word forms actually stored. README.md carried the opposite — "PRF
// terms are now stemmed with the same Porter algorithm used by FTS5, ensuring PRF expansion
// terms match the search index" — which inverts both halves. FTS5 here does not stem, and
// `extractPRFTerms` deliberately emits SURFACE forms *because* it does not; emitting a stem
// would match nothing.
//
// That claim had already been retracted once, in `tfidf.mjs`'s own docblock ("the 'porter
// tokenizer' claim the old docblock made here is NOT true"), and the README copy survived
// the retraction — the recurring failure this repo keeps paying for. So the guard is
// two-sided rather than a spelling check: it asserts the tokenizer's real behaviour against
// a live schema, and asserts the prose does not contradict it. Adding a porter tokenizer
// later is a legitimate change — it just has to take the README with it, which is the point.
