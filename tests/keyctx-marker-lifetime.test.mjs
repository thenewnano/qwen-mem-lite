// The Key Context marker is SESSION-scoped, but it is garbage-collected by AGE.
//
// hook.mjs sweeps `.qwen-mem-keyctx-*` at 24h mtime, on the same policy as the
// pre-recall cooldown and injected-ids markers. That policy fits those two — their
// semantics ARE time-windowed (the dedup window is 5 minutes). It does not fit this one:
// injected-ids.mjs documents the marker as "session-lifetime validity (no time window)",
// because the SessionStart block stays in context for as long as the session lives. A
// session that outlives 24h therefore has its own exclude-set swept out from under it, and
// handleUserPrompt starts re-injecting rows the Key Context block is still showing.
//
// Keying the sweep on session liveness does not work: hook.mjs marks any session older
// than STALE_SESSION_MS 'abandoned' by started_at_epoch, so the >24h session — the exact
// case — reads as dead in the DB too. What genuinely separates a live session from a dead
// one is whether it is still USING the marker. So the reader refreshes the mtime, and the
// age sweep then measures time since last use.
//
// Second half: handlePreCompact skipped the recorder entirely when the re-rendered body was
// empty, while handleSessionStart writes the marker even when empty — keyctx-marker.mjs's
// header states why ("written even when empty, so a resumed session can never act on a
// previous session's stale semantics") and that the two callers must describe the same set.
// The empty-body early return left the previous render's ids standing as an exclude-set for
// content that is about to be compacted away: suppression of rows that are no longer shown,
// which is the failure D#123 review C-1 already fixed once on the other leg.
