// R10-P3-21, tier 3 — the daily unattended `normalize` was the one path in this repo where
// ONE observation's content could rewrite rows in EVERY project.
//
// The chain, by NAME rather than by line number — the first version of this header cited
// eight line numbers and six of them pointed elsewhere within one commit, because they were
// read off the pre-change file and never re-derived:
//
//   hook.mjs                 handleLLMOptimize()
//   hook-optimize.mjs        optimizeRun(db, { reenrichScope: 'wide' })   <- passes no project
//                            executeNormalize(db, force, { project: undefined })
//                            extractUniqueConcepts -> every project's concepts
//                            identifySynonymGroups -> one flat prompt string
//                            applyNormalization    -> writes every project
//
// `applyNormalization`'s own comment says `--project` exists to stop exactly this and that
// NULL is the "legacy unscoped run" — the mode the unattended caller was still using.
//
// ── WHAT THE FIRST FIX GOT WRONG, found by independent review ────────────────────────────
//
// It kept the single union pass and policed the model's ANSWER: every returned canonical and
// alias had to be a member of the input concept set. That set is built from `concepts`, which
// is exactly what an attacker writes to, so storing `pwned` among their own concepts made it a
// legitimate member and the attack landed again — victim row read "pwned pagination coverage",
// byte-identical to the pre-fix reproduction. Any corpus-derived whitelist has that shape.
// The fix therefore moved to the STRUCTURE: an unscoped run now fans out to one scoped pass
// per project, so no prompt ever carries two projects' vocabulary and no answer can cross.
//
// A second wrong premise, also from review, was load-bearing and is corrected here rather
// than quietly dropped. The header used to say a payload "has to survive as ONE
// whitespace-free token. That rules out prose instructions." Both halves were false:
//   (a) `concepts` is persisted as `obs.concepts.join(' ')` from a free-form LLM array and
//       re-joined with ', ' for the prompt, so a multi-element array reads back as a phrase;
//   (b) JS `\\s` is a FIXED LIST — U+200B, U+0085, U+00AD, U+2060, U+007F and the C1
//       block are not in it, so a phrase joined with any of them IS one token.
// The gate is written against what was measured, not against that premise.
//
// ── WHAT REAL CONCEPTS LOOK LIKE, three populations, 2026-09-08 ──────────────────────────
//
//   real DB (~/.qwen-mem-lite)             1 row with concepts,  10 distinct, max len 13
//   benchmark/fixtures/seed-data.json      200 rows,              541 distinct, max len 22
//   benchmark/fixtures/seed-data-cjk.json   31 rows,               55 distinct, max len  9
//
// UNION = **598** distinct tokens, not 606. 606 is the SUM of the three, and an earlier draft
// called the sum "distinct" — the populations overlap by 8 (`tracking`, `search`, `API`,
// `pagination`, `sync` between the real DB and the fixtures; `probe`, `health`, `node`
// between the two fixtures). Counting instead of uniting name sets is the doctrine-rule-4
// mistake in miniature.
//
// Over that union: longest is `infrastructure-as-code` (22) and ZERO tokens contain any denied
// character. The real-DB arm is far too small to calibrate anything and is reported so nobody
// re-derives a threshold from it; the fixtures carry the weight.
//
// Bound on a false reject, so the gate is not read as scarier than it is: a rejected token is
// dropped from normalize's PROMPT only — never from the row, never from search. It does feed
// the `concepts.length < 5` skip, so a corpus whose vocabulary is mostly punctuation would
// turn normalize off rather than corrupt anything.
