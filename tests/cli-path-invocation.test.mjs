// pre-v3.1.1 `~/.qwen-mem-lite/cli.mjs`, which is absent on a plugin-only
// install (setup.sh provisions the data dir but never materializes source).
//
// Two correct strategies, asserted separately:
//   • JS-emitted/runtime-resolved surfaces  → absolute CLI_INVOKE (this file)
//   • plugin MANIFEST files (commands/*.md)  → literal ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}

  // >=104 chars, instr-full >=129, instr-BASE >=140 (the block embeds it zero times
  // and could never redden). This machine's CLI_PATH is 38 chars and the surfaces
