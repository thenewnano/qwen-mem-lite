// benchmark/rerank-pool-replay.mjs — the ruler for the `fyi` face's pool bounds.
//
// D#190. Both CHANGELOG and CLAUDE.md justify believing this ruler with the sentence
// "four self-checks, each verified able to fail", and v3.85.1's headline RULER note
// sells the nonEmptyToEmpty counterexample gate specifically. Those claims were true
// when written — the pre-tag review mutated each one and watched it fire — and nothing
// whatsoever kept them true: no file under tests/ imported this module, so the twin
// patch guard, the read-only assertion, the determinism check and the counterexample
// gate could all be deleted in one edit with 5337 cases still green. This project has
// the receipt: benchmark/citation-live-replay.mjs got its guard AFTER v3.82.0 found two
// of its self-checks removable from main() with a fully green suite.
//
// So: every check is driven here with synthetic inputs and watched to FAIL. A guard
// exercised only through the live corpus is a guard nobody has seen fire — and on a
// machine whose corpus happens to satisfy it, it never will.
