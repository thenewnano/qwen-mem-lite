// doctor must check the HOOK_SCRIPT_FILES manifest, not only SOURCE_FILES.
//
// `checkDevDrift` classifies whatever the caller hands it, and install.mjs hands it
// SOURCE_FILES — which holds zero `scripts/` entries. Hook scripts install from the
// separate HOOK_SCRIPT_FILES manifest into `~/.qwen-mem-lite/scripts/`, and every
// settings.json hook command names one of those ABSOLUTE paths. So the failure
// source-files.mjs documents — a tarball that shipped without `scripts/` — left every
// hook dead while doctor printed an all-clear. That is the fatal-in-every-shape case
// the v3.69.0 severity split was written to grade, and it was the unmonitored one.
//
// Severity here is NOT the SOURCE_FILES severity. #10686's split turns on which path
// RESOLVES the file, and the two manifests answer differently:
//
//   • SOURCE_FILES, dev install — each entry is its own symlink into the repo, so an
//     import-only module absent from the install dir is unreachable dead weight, benign.
//   • HOOK_SCRIPT_FILES, dev install — install.mjs symlinks the whole `scripts/` DIRECTORY
//     (install.mjs:417), so the install dir *is* the repo dir. A file missing there is
//     missing from the repo: broken, not benign. There is no per-file drift to detect.
//   • HOOK_SCRIPT_FILES, copy install — entry scripts are named by hook commands (dead if
//     absent) and `user-prompt-search.js` imports `./prompt-search-utils.mjs` against the
//     install dir (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND on every fire if absent). Both classes are fatal.
//
// So both classes count as issues in both shapes, and the entry/module split survives only
// in the WORDING. Asserted below in both directions so a future edit that copies the
// SOURCE_FILES demote branch over here goes red.
