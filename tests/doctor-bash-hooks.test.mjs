// Three of the hook commands are `bash "<script>"`, and nothing told the user when bash
// was missing — the hooks simply did not fire.
//
// This is the other half of issue #28. package.json's `os` list blocked Windows outright,
// and the commit that added it (b6a2579, R10 P3-19) said why: "a Windows user should be
// told rather than handed a string of silent catch blocks". Unblocking the install without
// building the telling channel would just move the silence — a Windows user with no Git
// Bash would get a working MCP server and three dead hooks, with nothing anywhere saying so.
//
// The check is keyed on the REAL condition (can bash run?) rather than on the proxy
// (process.platform === 'win32'), which matters in both directions: a Windows user WITH Git
// Bash on PATH — the normal case, since Claude Code shells out to bash for its own Bash tool
// — is told nothing, correctly; and a stripped Linux container with no bash IS told, which a
// platform check would have missed. It is also why this suite can drive it on Linux at all:
// emptying PATH is a real reproduction of the condition, where faking process.platform in a
// spawned process would only be a reproduction of the proxy.
//
// dwarn, not fail: a diagnostic that exits 1 on a configuration the user chose is one they
// stop running. Pinned by the issue-count case below.
