// The D#214 meter's arm B must leave NO trace — this file is the regression test for the
// defect the v3.90.0 pre-tag correctness review reproduced.
//
// `searchRelevantMemories` is not a read. Every successful call ends with
// `UPDATE observations SET injection_count = injection_count + 1, last_injected_at = ?`,
// and it emits its own `event: 'inject'` metric row. The first version of the meter handed
// that function the live writable handle for its counterfactual arm, which did three
// things, all confirmed by the reviewer with probes:
//
//   1. rows that were NEVER shown to the model reached `injection_count = 1`. That column
//      is read by `noisePenaltyClause` (×0.5 at >=4, ×0.2 at >=8), by `demotePinned`'s
//      `injection_count >= N AND cited_count = 0` predicate, and as the `= 0` GC-eligibility
//      gate — so the meter down-ranked, demoted and GC-protected rows on the strength of a
//      measurement nobody saw;
//   2. the ruler manufactured its own delta: arm A's bump could push a row across the >= 4
//      noise gate before arm B scored the corpus, so a prompt whose honest answer was
//      `suppressed 0 / refilled 0` reported `refilled: 1, setChanged: true`;
//   3. the sibling `inject` meter counted two calls per prompt — on exactly the installs
//      where the D#214 corpus gets gathered, since it is the same env flag.
//
// CLAUDE.md already carried this rule, for `rerank-pool-replay`: "the handle must reject a
// write (`searchRelevantMemories` bumps `injection_count` on every row it returns, so a
// writable handle would move the very noise signal being measured **and** let arm A's
// writes change arm B's scores)". The new ruler quoted that sentence in its own release
// note and then broke it.
//
// Two halves are pinned here, because the flag alone is not the fix:
//   - BEHAVIOUR: `counterfactual: true` writes nothing and emits nothing.
//   - WIRING: `hook.mjs` passes it, AND computes arm B BEFORE the delivered search. The
//     flag with the wrong order still yields defect (2) — arm A's bump would precede arm
//     B's read — so order is asserted by source position, not assumed.
