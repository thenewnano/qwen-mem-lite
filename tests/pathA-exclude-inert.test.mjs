// D#213 (re-filed from D#212, itself re-filed from D#193) — the path-A exclude set is
// currently INERT against string ids, and this file pins that so the state cannot change
// by accident.
//
// This is an unusual test: it asserts a defect. The reason is that repairing it is a
// behaviour change nobody has measured, so the dangerous outcome is not "the bug stays",
// it is "someone normalises a type in passing and up to 9% of one injection face
// disappears without anyone deciding to". (An earlier version of this line said 18%,
// carried over from the mirror-image population corrected 20 lines below — the wrong
// number outlived the paragraph that retracted it, in the same file.)
//
// THE MECHANISM, verified below rather than described:
//   - `user-prompt-search.js` writes plain numbers into the shared marker;
//   - `mergeCrossHookInjected` (pre-tool-recall.js) `.map(String)`s the whole union, so
//     once PreToolUse has emitted one row in the window every id in the file is a string;
//   - `hook.mjs` pushes them into `pathAInjectedIds` as-is;
//   - `searchRelevantMemories` and `rankImperativeCandidates` both test
//     `new Set(excludeIds).has(r.id)` against a NUMBER out of SQLite.
// A Set keyed by '42' does not contain 42, so the exclude drops nothing.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT that says why it is not simply fixed (2026-09-02T12:12Z, 99 real
// transcripts, one walk, through the shipped `extractInjectedBySurface`), stated as an
// UPPER bound because it is session-level and ignores the marker's stale window.
//
// The population is `ups ∩ (fyi ∪ pretool)`: the marker is WRITTEN by
// `user-prompt-search.js` (the `fyi` face) and `pre-tool-recall.js` (`pretool`), and READ
// in `hook.mjs handleUserPrompt`, which is the `ups` face. A first version of this header
// measured the mirror image and published 18.0% — the figure for a mechanism that is not
// this one; the pre-tag review caught it, and the wrong number reproduces exactly, which
// is what identifies it as a caliber error rather than corpus drift.
//
//   ups              23 of 256 (session, id) pairs — 9.0% — over 14 of 71 sessions
//   task_imperative   3 of  24 (12.5%) over 3 of 23
//   (by attachments rather than pairs: 29 of 332, 8.7%)
//
// Direction unknown — the freed slot is sometimes refilled and sometimes lost — and this
// path already has a WORKING suppressor in `shouldSkipByDedup`, which String-normalises
// both sides and skips the whole injection at >=0.8 overlap. Repairing this one adds a
// second suppressor to an already-suppressed face, which needs an A/B.
//
// THE RULER NOW EXISTS — `lib/patha-exclude-meter.mjs`, wired into the same read in
// `hook.mjs handleUserPrompt` and off unless `QWEN_MEM_METRICS=1`. It does NOT persist
// the marker for a later replay (the route the ledger leaned toward, and one this repo has
// a standing rule against: never diff two runs taken at different times). It runs both
// arms at the read, one database state, and records `suppressed` / `refilled` / `net` per
// prompt. So the missing input is now a matter of elapsed time rather than of method.
//
// WHEN THE TIME COMES: delete this file in the same commit that coerces the ids, and put
// the meter's own numbers in the commit message. A green suite after a silent coercion is
// the failure this file exists to prevent.
