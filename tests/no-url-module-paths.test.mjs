// Two rules, both about the same thing: ways of NAMING a repo module that make knip stop
// reporting that module's unused exports. Each is a silent loss — knip's count goes DOWN,
// which reads like an improvement.
//
//   1. D#207 — a repo-source path must be built with join(), never with
//      `new URL('../X.mjs', import.meta.url)`.
//   2. P1-8 — a dynamic import of a repo module must DESTRUCTURE its named bindings, never
//      member-access the awaited namespace.
//
// ─── Rule 1 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// WHY THIS IS A GUARD AND NOT A STYLE PREFERENCE. Naming a module that way anywhere in
// the analysed tree makes knip drop that module out of its unused-export report
// ENTIRELY — not the one export, the whole file. So a single test that reads a source
// file as text silently costs knip coverage of a module it has nothing to do with, and
// the loss is invisible: the count goes DOWN, which reads like an improvement.
//
// Established by probe, both directions, 2026-09-02. Appending
// `export const __KNIP_PROBE__ = 1;` to a module and running knip once shows whether knip
// can see it. SIX modules were blind for this reason — hook-context, hook-memory,
// search-engine, hook-semaphore, hook-llm, cli-path (plus lib/binding-probe, found by the
// guard itself). Converting every site to join() and re-running took the report from 46
// unused exports to 57: eleven dead exports that had been hidden, in search-engine.mjs
// (7), hook-llm.mjs (2) and hook-context.mjs (2).
//
// `hook.mjs` was named as a seventh in the first version of this header and that was
// WRONG, in a way worth keeping: it is invisible for a SECOND, independent reason this
// rule does not touch — it is listed in `knip.json`'s `entry` array, and knip's
// `includeEntryExports` defaults to false. Converting its call sites changed nothing for
// it, and it is still unreported today, as are `server.mjs` and `install.mjs`. Caught by
// the pre-tag review; do not read a green run of this file as knip coverage of an entry.
//
// It also happened live rather than in theory: adding
// `tests/pretool-event-id-namespace.test.mjs`, which read three source files this way,
// dropped `lib/citation-tracker.mjs:extractInjectedFromSubagentPrompt` out of the name
// set (46 -> 45) — a test file blinding knip to an unrelated module.
//
// This guard REPLACES tests/knip-blindspot-guard.test.mjs, which compensated for the
// blind spot on two modules by re-implementing part of what knip does. Removing the
// cause beats maintaining a stand-in with an allowlist: knip now sees those modules, so
// the real tool covers them and there is one fewer hand-maintained list to rot.
//
// SCOPE, stated because it is narrower than "no new URL": only a first argument that
// NAMES A MODULE (a relative specifier ending in .mjs or .js). The directory form,
// `new URL('..', import.meta.url)`, was NOT shown to blind anything and is not flagged —
// banning it would be a rule this file cannot support with evidence.

// knip's unused-export count fell 53 -> 49 and the four names that LEFT the list were all

// naming its PATH oddly, rule 2 by using its NAMESPACE oddly.

// SCOPE: relative specifiers only. `(await import('better-sqlite3')).default` is the
