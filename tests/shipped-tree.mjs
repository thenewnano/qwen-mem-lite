// Why this file exists: the v3.92.0 pre-tag test-effectiveness review found three guards
// (frontmatter, cite-recall path, symlink writes) that each swept a FIXED LIST of the file
// names the duplicate happened to occupy that day. Each one's header argued, correctly, that
// a unit test of the shared thing is not enough — and then implemented a sweep that is blind
// to the N+1th copy, which is the same defect from the other side. Two of them literally say
// "three copies existed because nothing stopped the third" while not stopping a fourth.
//
// Converting them meant three copies of a directory walk, so the walk lives here instead.
// The rule the guards encode is per-guard; the traversal is not.
//
// D#207: join(), never new URL('../X.mjs', import.meta.url) — the URL form makes knip blind
// to whatever module it names, and these files name shipped modules by construction.
