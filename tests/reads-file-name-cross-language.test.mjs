// `reads-<project>.txt` is written by bash, read by Node, and reaped by a third site — and
// no accessor can be shared across the language boundary.
//
// R12 gave the episode buffer a single spelling by routing every site through
// `episodeFile()`. Its sibling cannot be fixed that way: `scripts/post-tool-use.sh` appends
// the Read fast-path's file paths to this file without ever starting Node, so the name is
// necessarily written twice, once per language. What CAN be checked is that the two spellings
// agree — which is the only thing that makes them safe.
//
// The harm is already recorded in the writer's own comments, twice, from when it happened:
// a runtime dir resolved differently on the two sides "made flushEpisode read a DIFFERENT
// reads-<project>.txt, silently dropping this session's Read context AND orphaning the
// bash-named file (nothing ever collects it)". Note both halves: the reader goes quiet AND
// the writer's file becomes garbage nobody reaps.
//
// THREE SITES, NOT TWO, and the third is why this guard checks the sweeper as well:
//
//   scripts/post-tool-use.sh   writes   "${runtime_dir}/reads-${project}.txt"
//   hook.mjs                   reads    join(RUNTIME_DIR, `reads-${…}.txt`)
//   hook-shared.mjs            reaps    f.startsWith('reads-') && f.endsWith('.txt')
//
// The sweeper matches on a PREFIX and a SUFFIX rather than constructing the name, so a
// renamed file is not merely unread — it is also never collected, and grows without bound in
// the user's runtime directory. A guard that compared only the writer and the reader would
// pass while that third site silently stopped reaping.
//
// POPULATION: this is one of the three shipped bash hooks that `walkShipped` (".mjs/.js") is
// structurally blind to — the blind spot that hid two setup.sh defects for twelve audit
// rounds. Both shipped languages are named explicitly here rather than swept.
