// Audit 2026-09-02 P1-14: `QWEN_MEM_RUNTIME_DIR` did not relocate the runtime directory,
// it SPLIT it.
//
// Six places honoured it (the five standalone hook scripts + hook-launcher) and two did
// not: `hook-shared.mjs` — which `hook.mjs`, `server.mjs`, `hook-context.mjs` and
// `hook-episode.mjs` all take `RUNTIME_DIR` from — and `hook-optimize.mjs`. So a harness
// that set the variable got the `fyi`/`pretool` faces writing markers into the override
// while `ups`/`keyctx` read them from the real directory. No error, no empty directory, no
// way to notice; `experiment/lib/arms.mjs` uses exactly this variable to keep an arm off
// real state.
//
// The whole suite passed before the fix AND after it, which is the reason this file exists:
// nothing anywhere asserted the variable did what its name says. A guard nobody would miss
// is a guard nobody is keeping.
