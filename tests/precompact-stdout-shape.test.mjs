// PreCompact must write BARE text to stdout — never the hook-stdout JSON envelope.
//
// This is the one hook face in the tree where the envelope is wrong, so it reads like
// an inconsistency waiting to be tidied up. It is not. Verified against the Claude Code
// 2.1.260 bundle (2026-09-04):
//
//   • the hook runner sets `result.output = status === 0 ? stdout : stderr` — the RAW
//     stdout, whatever it is, separately from the parsed `answer`;
//   • `executePreCompactHooks` reads exactly that field:
//       v = results.filter(r => r.succeeded && !r.blocked && r.output.trim()).map(r => r.output.trim())
//       return { newCustomInstructions: v.length ? v.join("\n\n") : undefined, … }
//   • and `newCustomInstructions` is handed to the compaction summarizer as its
//     `customInstructions` — six read sites in the 2.1.260 bundle.
//
// So routing this through lib/hook-stdout.mjs would deliver `{"hookSpecificOutput":…}`
// to the summarizer as its literal instruction text. The header of lib/hook-stdout.mjs
// used to assert the opposite ("every other event — dropped in silence"), which would
// have made hook-precompact.mjs look like dead code; both are corrected together.
//
// Two assertions, on purpose. The behavioural one pins what actually reaches the host;
// the source one names the specific refactor that would break it, because a future
// envelope emitted only on a code path this fixture does not reach would slip past the
// first assertion alone.
