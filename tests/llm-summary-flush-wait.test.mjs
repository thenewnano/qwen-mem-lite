// Audit 2026-09-02 P1-7: `handleLLMSummary` waited for `readdirSync(RUNTIME_DIR)` to hold no
// `ep-flush-*` file at all — a condition about the WHOLE MACHINE, checked by a worker that
// only cares about its own session's flushes.
//
// Two unbounded consequences, and the first is the expensive one: a single crashed
// llm-episode worker leaves a flush file nothing deletes, so from then on EVERY project's
// summary burns the full timeout on EVERY Stop until a maintain run sweeps it — and orphan
// cleanup sits behind a 24 h gate. The second: an unrelated project flushing while this
// summary waits extends the wait, for work this summary will never read.
//
// The fix is a defined set snapshotted at entry, filtered to files young enough to belong to
// a live worker. These cases drive the real `handleLLMSummary` and measure the thing that
// actually went wrong — elapsed time — rather than asserting on the shape of the filter.

// 1.1 s is first observed gone on the SECOND tick, at ~2.0 s. Every bound below is stated in
// ticks for that reason — a bound placed between two adjacent ticks is a coin flip, not a

/**
 * Timeout for the two cases that assert "did not burn the timeout", and the bound they use.
 *
 * These two used the 3 s default, which left them exactly ONE tick of margin: a correct run
 * lands at ~2 s and the ceiling was 3 s. Measured 2026-09-08 on an idle machine, 6/6 runs
 * read 2013-2018 ms — 982-987 ms of headroom. Delaying the removal timer by a single tick,
 * which is what a loaded runner does to a `setTimeout`, put 6/6 runs at 3013-3032 ms and
 * reproduced `expected 3022 to be less than 3000` — the failure that turned v6.0.0's Release
 * validate job red AFTER the tag had been pushed.
 *
 * 8 s with a 5-tick bound instead. A correct run still exits on tick 2, so the bound sits 3
 * ticks above the expected value; a dir-wide predicate waits on the latecomer for all 8,
 * so it sits 3 ticks below the broken one. Symmetric, and both halves are a tick count
 * rather than a tuned millisecond. Raising the timeout costs no suite time in the green
 * case — a correct run exits when ITS file clears, not when the timeout expires.
