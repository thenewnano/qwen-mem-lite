// Audit 2026-09-02 P1-7: `handleLLMSummary` waited for `readdirSync(RUNTIME_DIR)` to hold no
// `ep-flush-*` file at all — a condition about the WHOLE MACHINE, checked by a worker that
// only cares about its own session's flushes.
//
// Two unbounded consequences, and the first is the expensive one: a single crashed
// llm-episode worker leaves a flush file nothing deletes, so from then on EVERY project's
// summary burns the full timeout on EVERY Stop until a maintain run sweeps it — and orphan
// cleanup sits behind a 24 h gate. The second: an unrelated project flushing while this
// summary waits extends the wait, for work this summary will never read.
//
// The fix is a defined set snapshotted at entry, filtered to files young enough to belong to
// a live worker. These cases drive the real `handleLLMSummary` and measure the thing that
// actually went wrong — elapsed time — rather than asserting on the shape of the filter.

 * ticks above the expected value; a dir-wide predicate waits on the latecomer for all 8,
