// R9 discoverability signal (§EXT §2-EXT, released-artifact checklist item 4).

// The skill registry was removed in a breaking release. A user with `registry` /
// `import` / `enrich` in a script or in muscle memory gets `Unknown command`, which
// is true and useless: it reads as a typo, and the edit-distance suggester makes it
// worse by proposing `import-jsonl` for `import` — a DIFFERENT feature that would
// happily run against a GitHub URL and do something unintended.
//
// So the router names the removal explicitly. These cases pin BOTH halves: the hint
// fires for exactly the three removed names, and does NOT fire for an ordinary typo.
