//
// Three modules shipped a byte-identical private `atomicWrite` (temp + rename onto the
// PATH). `renameSync` onto a symlink NAME replaces the link with a regular file, so a
// CLAUDE.md or MEMORY.md symlinked into a dotfiles repo (chezmoi/stow/yadm) or a monorepo's
// shared root gets silently severed — the user's only signal is a git typechange, and
// edits to the shared source stop applying. `lib/atomic-write.mjs` was written FOR this
// failure mode (it says so in its own docblock) and install.mjs had been using it for
// ~/.claude/settings.json the whole time; the three copies never picked it up.
//
// Deliberately written per WRITE FACE rather than as one unit test of atomicWriteFileSync:
// a unit test of the shared writer stays green if a caller keeps its private twin, which is
// exactly the state this test exists to prevent recurring. Each case drives the module's
// real public entry point (#10716 — assert through the shipped path, don't re-encode the
// rule as a second literal).
