// Every spawnBackground site must honour its event's skip flag — at EVERY call site.
//
// hook.mjs already has an invariant for these workers: tests/audit-findings-20260814.test.mjs
// reds when a spawned event is missing from BG_EVENTS, because a missing entry makes the
// detached worker exit(0) in a way that looks exactly like "ran and found nothing". That
// guard checks the event NAME. It cannot see a call site that skips the event's SUPPRESSION
// FLAG, which is the defect this file covers.
//
// Found while measuring D#2: `llm-summary` was gated by QWEN_MEM_SKIP_SUMMARY at its
// handleStop call site and ungated at its SessionStart handoff call site. The flag exists
// because that worker recreates a test's sandbox tree behind the test's own cleanup — the
// comment at the gated site records a recreate timed at 432ms beating a 300ms grace period,
// i.e. "wait a bit" is a race, not a barrier. A flag honoured at one of two call sites
// cannot do that job.
//
// This is a source scan, chosen deliberately over a behavioural one: hook.mjs dispatches on
// process.argv at module scope, so it cannot be imported in-process to spy on the spawn, and
// the subprocess route cannot discriminate a suppressed spawn from a spawned worker that
// died on the missing `claude` binary the suite points it at. The counter-example is
// therefore taken from the real pre-fix line rather than invented.
