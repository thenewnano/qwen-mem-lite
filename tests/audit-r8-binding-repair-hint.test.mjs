// A20260906-R8-P1-1 — no user-facing repair hint may print a command that reports success
// on a still-dead binding.
//
// `npm rebuild better-sqlite3 --dangerously-allow-all-scripts` prints "rebuilt dependencies
// successfully" and exits 0 while compiling nothing on better-sqlite3 13, which declares no
// install script (measured 2026-09-06 in a mktemp sandbox on npm 12.0.2, with prebuilds
// present and with them deleted). Every "Repair:" line in the product printed exactly that
// command — doctor's included, via lib/install-shape — while the command that DOES heal was
// added in v4.0.0 and shown to nobody.
//
// The CHANGELOG records this same defect once already (the hints used to say
// `--build-from-source`, which no-oped the same way). That fix was correct for
// better-sqlite3 12 and expired silently when the dependency was bumped — so the guard here
// is deliberately about the SHAPE of a hint, not about one command string.

// 2026-09-06, found by tests/sandbox/phaseB-npm.mjs after its self-heal section was
// un-blinded: the npm pair above heals a platform that ships NO prebuild, and cannot heal a
// prebuild that is present and will not load. better-sqlite3 13 picks
// `prebuilds/<target>.node` on existence alone and prefers it over `build/`, so the addon
// the source build produces stays shadowed — measured with a control in
// docs/measurement/findings.md. The only repair that covers both is the bundled CLI's
// `rebuild-binding`, because the quarantine step lives inside ensureBetterSqlite3Working.
//
// So the hint must LEAD with that, and the npm pair becomes the fallback for a tree with no
// CLI beside it. Same defect as A20260906-R8-P1-1 in a new shape: a printed repair that
// cannot repair is worse than no repair, because the user stops looking.
