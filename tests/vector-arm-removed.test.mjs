// tests/vector-arm-removed.test.mjs — the TF-IDF vector arm is GONE (Phase-2).
//
// Phase-1 (v3.17.0, 2026-06-27) gated the arm off and kept the tables + code
// "pending Phase-2 removal". Phase-2 is this. The measurements that decided it are
// stamped in tasks/specs/vector-arm-removal.md; the short version is that the arm is
// net-NEGATIVE on both fixtures, including the vocabulary-mismatch suite that is the
// only reason a vector arm would exist (R@10 0.3407 -> 0.3018; P95 median-of-5 +88%).
//
// These cases are written to fail on the pre-removal tree. Each states which mechanism
// it drives, because a removal guard that only greps source text goes vacuously green
// the moment someone re-adds the feature under a different name.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO BEHAVIOURAL "the env var changes nothing" CASE HERE. One was written
// and DELETED rather than counted: at unit scale the arm cannot be made to engage
// through the shipped save path, so any pass would be vacuous. Measured while building
// it, on this tree — 12 saves of deliberately distinct rows with QWEN_MEM_VECTORS=1
// land 12 observations but **N = 1** for buildVocabulary, because the three-tier dedup
// in saveObservation marks the other 11 superseded and liveObsFilterSql('') hides them;
// with one live document every term has df = 1, the `freq >= 2` filter empties the
// candidate set, and the vocabulary comes back with 0 terms (version d41d8cd98f00 =
// md5 of the empty string). 0 vectors written, both through saves and through an
// explicit rebuildVocabulary. (First reading of this was blamed on _vocabCache
// poisoning; that was wrong — the explicit rebuild is empty too. Recorded as measured,
// not as the mechanism first guessed.)
//
// The behavioural evidence lives at fixture scale instead, in the benchmark A/B stamped
// in tasks/specs/vector-arm-removal.md, and is re-checked after this removal by
// success-criterion #1: `node benchmark/benchmark.mjs --production-hybrid` must still
// read 0.8998 / 0.8497 / 0.9712 / 0.9611, to the digit.
