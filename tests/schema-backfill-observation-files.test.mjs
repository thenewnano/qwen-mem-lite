// The junction backfill could only ever run on a database that had never stored a single
// file edge (R12 pre-ship review P3-3).
//
// `initSchema` carried a one-shot data migration gated on `COUNT(*) FROM observation_files
// === 0`. That reads as "run once", and it is — but the condition is not "has this backfill
// run", it is "has this database ever written an edge". Any store holding one real
// `mem_save` fails it forever, so observations imported before v6.7.2 — the release that
// taught `import-jsonl` to write edges at all — stayed permanently unreachable by file. A
// re-import does not repair them either: cross-run dedup skips the row before the edge write.
//
// The fix moves it to DEFERRED_CLEANUPS, whose marker answers the question actually being
// asked (`migration_cleanups.name`), retries on a later open if it throws, and needs no
// CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION bump — a bump would lock every older code home out of the database
// permanently, which is far too much to pay for a derived table.
