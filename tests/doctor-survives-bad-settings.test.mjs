// A settings.json the user is midway through hand-editing must not silence doctor.
//
// Audit 2026-09-08 (P1-2). `readSettings()` throws on a file that exists and does not
// parse — correct for install / uninstall, whose every write path merges into its return
// value (R10 P1-8), and inherited by doctor, which never writes it. One trailing comma
// therefore aborted the run at the Plugin-lifecycle check: nine later checks never ran and
// `--json` emitted zero bytes. That is the state a user is in when they run doctor.
//
// Three cases, and the third is load-bearing: the obvious way to "fix" this is to soften
// readSettings() itself, which would silently restore the wholesale-overwrite bug R10 P1-8
// was filed for. The install/uninstall refusal is pinned here so that repair cannot pass.
