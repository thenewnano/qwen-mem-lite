// D#202 — the `[mem] Lessons for <file>:` block mixes two TABLES and rendered
// both as a bare `#NN`.
//
// Measured on the maintainer's metrics log before the fix (4227 `pretool_recall`
// firings, 2026-07-18 -> 2026-09-02): 2376 of 5291 injected rows — 44.9% — came
// from `events`, and 40.2% of firings injected events only. So this is nearly
// half the channel, not a corner.
//
// Two consequences, and only the second is closed here:
//
//  1. A reader cannot tell which table an id belongs to. That is how it was
//     found: `save --supersedes 10524` on an id read out of this block did
//     nothing, because 10524 is an `events` row. The silence there is D#201,
//     already fixed; the ambiguity that produced the wrong id is this.
//
//  2. Worse, and structural: `extractInjectedFromPreToolUse` reads ids off this
//     block into the citation-decay DENOMINATOR, and applyCitationDecay resolves
//     them against `observations` alone (`WHERE id = ? AND project = ?`). An
//     event id that happens to match a live same-project observation therefore
//     streaks or promotes a completely unrelated memory. Measured: of 5476
//     injectable events, 1406 (25.7%) share an id with a live observation, and
//     198 (3.6%) with one in the SAME project — the same-project condition is
//     the one that matters, because it is in the decay SELECT.
//
// The fix is entirely in the renderer, and it is not a new convention: the `E#`
// prefix already existed in lib/events-injection.mjs, whose header even
// enumerates the extractors it protects — FYI, memory-context, error-recall —
// and does not name pre-tool-recall.js, the one face that was breaking it. So
// this was an invariant asserted in one file about faces living in others, with
// the offending face simply never enumerated (#10379's shape).
//
// `INJECTED_ROW_RE` anchors `#` after at most six spaces, so an `E#` row cannot
// match it and the ids drop out of the injected set by construction — no second
// list to keep in sync. That is load-bearing rather than incidental, so both
// halves are pinned below: the prefix on both render paths, and that `event`
// must never join the extractor's bounded type list.
//
// NOT closed: `bumpCitationAccess` credits access_count for a cited `#NN`, and the
// `boost` maintain op turns enough of those into an importance bump (obs #10911,
// D#206), so the same same-project collision still misattributes there. Note the
// gate this does NOT lack: since v3.84.0 the credit requires the id to have been
// injected this session (or typed by the user), so "without asking whether it was
// injected at all" — how this comment first read — is wrong. What it does not ask is
// whether the lesson was ACTED on. Different mechanism from the prefix, different fix.
