// Audit 2026-09-02 P1-15, second half: `doctor` renders 26 distinct check lines and 15 of
// them appear NOWHERE under `tests/`. The ones with no coverage are exactly the ones that
// matter — a health check nobody has ever seen fire is a health check nobody knows can
// fire, and doctor's whole job is telling a user why their install is broken.
//
// Three failure branches are pinned here, each driven through the real `install.mjs doctor
// --json` in a subprocess against a fixture HOME. `--json` rather than the human output
// because the level (`fail`/`warn`) is the assertion — matching on the ✗ glyph or on prose
// pins the rendering instead of the verdict.
//
// Every case asserts a PREMISE first: that the same fixture reports the check as `ok` once
// the defect is removed. Without it, "the entry says fail" also passes when the fixture is
// so broken that doctor never reaches the check at all — and a check that never ran is the
// exact thing this file exists to catch.
