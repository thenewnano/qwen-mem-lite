// The bash-hook check has to read whichever hook registration is LIVE, and there are two.
//
// Pre-ship review of the issue-#28 round (P1-1) found the first cut reading only
// `<PROJECT_DIR>/hooks/hooks.json` and, when that file was absent, printing a green
// `✓ Hook interpreter: no hook command needs bash`. That arm is not hypothetical: it is the
// npm / npx / `git clone` shape. `hooks/hooks.json` is in RELEASE_SIGNED_FILES but NOT in
// SOURCE_FILES (`source-files.mjs` — verified: `SOURCE_FILES.filter(f => f.startsWith('hooks/'))`
// is empty), so the installed copy under ~/.qwen-mem-lite/ has no `hooks/` directory at
// all — while that same shape is the one that registers bash hooks through settings.json.
//
// So on the shape where two bash hooks really are live, doctor asserted there were none.
// That is worse than the silence the whole round exists to remove: a warning that never
// fires leaves a user searching, but a green line that says "nothing to look at" ends the
// search. It also falsified a SHIPPED promise — both READMEs tell the reader
// `qwen-mem-lite doctor` reports a missing bash, and `qwen-mem-lite` is the ~/.local/bin
// symlink pointing at exactly the copy with no manifest.
//
// The rule this encodes: THREE outcomes, never two. A count of zero is only reportable when
// a registration was actually read; "I could not find any registration" is its own answer and
// must not borrow zero's voice.
