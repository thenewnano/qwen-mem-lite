// FLOW-1 (2026-08-29 audit): the background maintenance family had no cross-process mutex.
//
// handleAutoMaintain is shaped read-gate → long work → write-gate. Two Claude Code windows
// booting either side of the 24h boundary both read "due" and both spawn a worker, and the
// overlap breaks an invariant decayAndMarkIdle documents in its own docblock: it marks
// idle rows BEFORE it decays, so that an imp-2 row cannot be decayed 2→1 and then hidden as
// COMPRESSED_PENDING_PURGE by the same pass (each importance tier is supposed to buy a
// grace cycle). Across two processes that ordering does not exist — worker A decays 2→1,
// worker B's mark-idle sees a qualifying imp-1 row and hides it, 37 days from a hard delete.
//
// Every case here is deterministic: the "peer is mid-pass" state is created by writing the
// lock file with THIS process's pid rather than by racing two workers, so nothing depends
// on scheduling. The control case in each pair is what makes the negative assertions mean
// something — without it, "the row was not marked" is equally consistent with a fixture
// that was never markable.
