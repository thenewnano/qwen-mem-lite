// Cold-start UPS injection: a first-week corpus must not be structurally silent.
//
// v3.61.0 scaled the two set-level score floors by ln(N+1)/ln(N_REF+1) to fix
// "new install injects nothing". That ramp has the right asymptotics but the wrong
// small-N shape: FTS5's IDF term is `log((N - df + 0.5) / (df + 0.5))`, which is
// EXACTLY 0 at N=2/df=1 and stays well under ln(N+1) across the whole first-week
// window. Re-measured end-to-end through the PRODUCTION write path
// (lib/save-observation.mjs — a raw INSERT skips CJK bigram expansion, which is how
// the first cut's ramp table got misread), 1 planted target + topically clustered
// filler, CJK prose prompt:
//
//   N              2     3     4     5     6    10    25    80
//   top|bm25|     0.0   5.1   7.0   9.5  11.4  15.5  22.2  30.3
//   ln ramp floor 5.2   6.5   7.6   8.4   9.2  11.3  15.3  20.7   ← DROP at N≤4
//
// Why the prompt is Chinese prose and not English: the upstream hasExplicitSignal
// gate only lets a prompt reach these floors if it names a file, an error signature,
// a tech identifier, or is CJK past the length gate. When the signal is a tech
// identifier, the identifier bypass restores rows the floors dropped — so an English
// probe naming JWT_SECRET passes with OR without the floor fix and proves nothing.
// CJK prose is the shape that reaches the floors with nothing to rescue it, which is
// also the shape this project's own users write.
//
// These are END-TO-END assertions (spawn the hook, read stdout) at production floor
// defaults, NOT assertions about the scale formula: a test mirroring the formula
// cannot tell a right formula from a wrong one.

// CI runner once the suite grew (v3.70.0 Release run 32070192835) — a scheduling
// deadline, not a behaviour change: nothing here got slower, there is just more
// competing for two cores. Raising the budget keeps every assertion intact; capping it
// at 20s would only convert contention into a red release.

// D#203 — the budget was blown again at 60s (run 33605998984), and the number is NOT

// code cannot get 18x slower on one leg, so the stall is the runner and no fixed budget
// is safe against a multiplier — the base cost is the only term under our control. It is
// now ~2.4x smaller (see `seedCorpus`), which is what buys the headroom; 60s stays.
