// Regression: ensureDb() must run the sentinel-gated deferred data cleanups on
// every open (audit P1-5 wiring).
//
// Bug (pre-fix): the orphan-observation-{files,vectors} + project-name cleanups
// were extracted from initSchema into runDeferredCleanups() — gated per-step by a
// migration_cleanups row so a transient failure retries instead of being stamped
// past forever (see lesson #8769). But the runner was never wired into any
// production opener: ensureDb() called only initSchema(), so the cleanups ran
// NOWHERE outside tests, even though schema.mjs:766 claims they run "on EVERY
// ensureDb". Net effect of the half-fix: cleanups silently stopped executing.
//
// This file MUST set QWEN_MEM_DIR and dynamic-import schema.mjs BEFORE any
// static import binds DB_DIR — otherwise ensureDb() would open the real user DB
// at ~/.qwen-mem-lite (a destructive-path violation).
