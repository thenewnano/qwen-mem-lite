// doctor's stale-temp COUNT and cleanup's stale-temp DELETION are the same question asked
// twice, and they have drifted twice: v3.93.0 on the directory, D#53 on the age gate. Both
// times the fix was to align one copy with the other, and both times nothing stopped the
// next divergence.
//
// So the guard here is BEHAVIOURAL and end-to-end rather than a source scan. The two faces
// are now wired to one classifier in lib/doctor-stale-temp.mjs, which makes agreement
// structural — but "structural" is exactly what the previous two fixes also believed, and a
// source scan would pass the moment someone re-implements the gate inline with the same
// spelling. Running both faces over one fixture cannot be fooled that way.
//
// Measured pre-fix on this fixture shape: doctor said 3, cleanup removed 0 and printed
// "No stale files found."
