// D#168's headline exclusion, which was the one piece of it with no test.
//
// Two repo-walking invariant scanners got purpose-built probe cases; the `test.exclude`
// entry — the thing that actually stops a scratch `*.test.mjs` under `tmp/` from being
// COLLECTED AND RUN, which is what the defect report was about — had none. Deleting
// `'tmp/**'` was silent. Review measured the delta: collection goes 304 → 305 files.
//
// A probe that plants a file and re-runs collection would mean spawning vitest from
// inside vitest. Asserting the resolved config is the same seam `tests/coverage-scope`
// uses for `coverage.exclude`, and it is enough: the pattern is either in the array the
// runner reads, or it is not.
