// A database doctor has just declared unusable must not then be opened for writing.
//
// R12 audit 2026-09-08, partition C (P2-5). The schema-skew check exists for one
// reason, stated in lib/schema-skew.mjs's own header: a DB written by a NEWER
// claude-mem-lite locks every older code home out, permanently. doctor computes
// that verdict, prints it as a `fail` — and then, with nothing gating it, opens
// the same file READ-WRITE, runs `checkFTSIntegrity` (an
// `INSERT INTO fts VALUES('integrity-check')`, which needs a write lock), and on
// an unhealthy index would go on to `rebuildFTS`. Two things go wrong at once:
// the machine that is behind is handed a path to write the newer layout, and the
// screen reports "all indexes healthy" about a store the same screen just said
// this install cannot use.
//
// The green line is the proof of the write — but not for the reason the first
// draft of this comment gave, which review measured and found false.
// `checkFTSIntegrity` does NOT throw on a readonly handle: its INSERT sits inside
// a per-table try (schema.mjs), so it completes and returns
// `{healthy: false, details: [... "CORRUPT (attempt to write a readonly database)"]}`.
// The conclusion survives, by the other half: on a readonly handle the line that
// appears says CORRUPT, so "all indexes healthy" appearing AT ALL means a
// write-capable handle ran it. Assert the observable, not the mechanism you
// assumed produced it.
//
// The audit's `-wal`/`-shm` sidecar assertion is deliberately NOT carried, because
// `rwDb.close()` removes both and the residue is not observable after the run.
//
// The rebuild half is out of reach of a behavioural test — it needs skew AND a
// corrupt FTS index at once — so it is gated by construction (inside the same
// branch) rather than pinned here. Said plainly rather than implied.
