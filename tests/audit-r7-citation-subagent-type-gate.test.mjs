// Regression pin for audit 2026-09-05 R7 P1-1 (docs/audits/20260905-225651.md).
//
// `extractInjectedFromSubagentPrompt` walked EVERY transcript entry, filtering only on the
// marker text + a row anchor — no `entry.type` gate. So a subagent that merely QUOTED the
// injection block in its own assistant text had those `#NN` counted as injected; and because
// `collectSubagentSurface` takes a per-file `seen ∩ said` intersection, the same quotation
// landed in the cited set too. The id then reads 100% cite-rate off one self-reference.
//
// The sibling face defends the identical shape deliberately: SURFACE_MATCHERS.task_imperative
// gates on the COMMAND as well as the framing, with the reason spelled out in its docblock —
// "a transcript that merely quotes the framing — a review of this code, say — is not counted
// as an injection". This face had no equivalent.
//
// Three downstream consumers made it more than a metering error:
//   1. hook.mjs:1250 uses `sub.injected.size > 0` as a citation-decay ENTRY gate (with
//      QWEN_MEM_SUBAGENT_DECAY defaulting on), so a phantom id starts a decay pass that
//      writes cited_count / uncited_streak / demoted_at on a session with no real injection.
//   2. hook.mjs:1184 feeds `sub.injected` into buildCitationRelevanceSet, which is the
//      allow-list for bumpCitationAccess → access_count → the `boost` maintain op → importance.
//   3. citation_surface_log's `subagent` face rate is the number D#164/D#177 were decided on.
//
// Aggravating, and the reason the gate value had to be MEASURED rather than assumed: the
// reader runs unconditionally (hook.mjs:1166) while the writer is default-off
// (QWEN_MEM_SUBAGENT_INJECT, scripts/pre-agent-inject.js:16), so on a default install every
// id this extractor finds is a false positive by construction.
//
// GATE VALUE, MEASURED (2026-09-05, 11 real subagent transcripts under ~/.claude/projects):
// the dispatched task prompt — the thing pre-agent-inject.js appends to — is the FIRST entry
// of each subagent file and carries `type='user'`, `role='user'`, `isSidechain=true`. Entry
// types present across the corpus: assistant ×1036, attachment ×973, user ×668. Gating on
// 'user' therefore keeps the real injection and excludes the 2009 entries that could quote it.
// Guessing here would have been a coin flip between 100% false positives and 100% false
// negatives, which is why the report blocked the fix on this measurement.
