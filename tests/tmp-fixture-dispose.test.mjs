// D#2. Guards `disposeFixtureDir` in tests/test-helpers.mjs.
//
// What the helper is for is written up at its definition; the short version is that the
// four leaking suites all HAD an afterEach, and the 11 dirs one run left behind came from
// disposing the wrong path (9) and from a detached worker recreating the data dir after a
// successful removal (2, sweeper-absorbed by adjudication).
//
// The reporting branch is the case worth guarding hardest: a bare `catch {}` is what let
// this run green for months, so the helper must stay loud.
//
// Each case can say NO: dropping `maxRetries` reds the first, dropping the `console.warn`
// reds the third, dropping the nullish guard reds the fourth. Mutation-verified against
// all four.
