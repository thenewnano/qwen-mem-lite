//
// It was installed for EVERY hook.mjs invocation, background workers included. Those seven
// workers (llm-episode, llm-summary, auto-compress, llm-optimize, auto-maintain,
// enrich-save, update-check) do not own the live `ep-<project>.json` buffer — the
// interactive session does. So `pkill node`, or a machine shutdown, had every running
// worker flush that buffer to the DB and then unlink it, none of them holding the episode
// lock, while an interactive session was still appending to it.
//
// Driven as real subprocesses under a sandboxed data dir, because hook.mjs process.exit()s
// during import and the handler cannot be reached any other way (the note at the top of
// tests/save-episode-immediate.test.mjs makes the same point).

  // in ~92 ms, llm-optimize ~82 ms, llm-episode / llm-summary / enrich-save / auto-compress
  // all under 400 ms, and update-check lives ~2 s but blocks its loop on a network call, so
  // the handler never runs — verified against the UNFIXED code, where none of the six
  // deleted the buffer. In production they are alive for seconds precisely because they are
  // waiting on model calls, which is when `pkill node` or a shutdown reaches them; a
  // sandbox with no model configured cannot reproduce that.
  //
  // So this pins the gate itself. It goes red on a revert of the fix, which is the shape
  // that matters, and it says out loud what it does not cover.
