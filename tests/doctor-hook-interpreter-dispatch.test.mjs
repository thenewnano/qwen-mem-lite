// The DISPATCH, which is the half `resolveBashHookCount`'s own tests never covered.
// That helper was already exported and already unit-tested; what had no unit coverage was
// the code that turns its {count, source, scripts} plus a bash probe into doctor's ok/⚠
// lines — and that is exactly where the pre-ship review found P1-1 (a green
// "no hook command needs bash" printed on a shape where two were registered).
//
// It had no coverage for a structural reason, not an oversight: it shelled out to `bash`,
// so one of its four outcomes needs a machine without bash. tests/doctor-bash-hooks.test.mjs
// buys that one by spawning doctor with an emptied PATH, which works and is slow and can only
// assert on the rendered report. Injecting the probe makes all four reachable in-process.
// Both are kept: the E2E proves the wiring, these prove the branches.
