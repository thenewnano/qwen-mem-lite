// The pre-commit hook git will ACTUALLY run must be scripts/pre-commit.sh — audit
// 2026-09-02 P1-11.
//
// `.git/hooks/` is untracked, so a clone starts with no hook and a copy made once goes
// stale in silence. Measured on the maintainer's machine: `.git/hooks/pre-commit` was a
// 2050 B copy from 2026-03-27 against a 6290 B `scripts/pre-commit.sh` — 72 lines of
// divergence, meaning the `@emnapi` lockfile-pruning guard and the frozen-corpus commit
// gate had never once run locally. Nothing in the repo installed or checked the hook:
// no `prepare` script, no `hooksPath` mention anywhere, no `.githooks/`.
//
// The fix is `core.hooksPath = .githooks` plus a tracked one-line exec shim, and this
// pins it. Two cases, and they cover different machines on purpose: the MODE case runs
// everywhere including CI (it reads the git index), the WIRING case can only run where a
// hook is actually installed and skips loudly elsewhere rather than asserting something
// vacuously true (#10831 — `expect(list).toContain('x')` passes on a walker that ignores
// the list entirely).
