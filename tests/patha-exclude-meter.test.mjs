// lib/patha-exclude-meter.mjs — the ruler for D#213.
//
// Every ruler in this repo that shipped without a test under `tests/` later turned out to
// have a self-check that could be deleted with a green suite (citation-live-replay in
// v3.82.0, rerank-pool-replay in D#190). This file exists so that does not happen a third
// time, and it drives each guarantee to FAIL rather than asserting the happy path:
//
//   - the coercion must DROP `E<id>` and must not smuggle NaN into the exclude set;
//   - every count column must come from its own input (a review found `delivered`,
//     `emitted` and `markerTotal` each replaceable by a constant with the file green);
//   - the recorded event name must be pinned to the LITERAL, not to the imported
//     constant — that comparison is a tautology, and renaming the constant orphaned
//     every recorded row with the whole suite green;
//   - `setChanged` must survive a one-for-one replacement, where `net` is 0;
//   - a failed arm B must be recorded as an error, never as "no difference";
//   - the gate must be able to say no (metrics off, empty marker, non-array marker).
//
// Arm B's ORDERING and side-effect freedom are not asserted here — they are properties of
// the caller, and they live in tests/patha-meter-counterfactual.test.mjs.
//
// Note on `inert`: it is per PROMPT, not a constant, and it is defined on ids that are
// coercible AND arrived as strings — not on "some string is present". A draft used the
// looser rule on the belief that only a PreToolUse emission can turn the union into
// strings; that is false (UPS writes `P<id>` and `D<id>` itself, and its deferred leg
// merges `prevIds.map(String)`), and under the loose rule a marker of nothing but those
// namespaces counted as inert while having nothing excludable at all. Both the working
// case and that shape are asserted below.
