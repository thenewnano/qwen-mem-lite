// `doctor` must grade a missing SOURCE_FILES entry by INSTALL SHAPE, because the same
// fact means opposite things in the two shapes — and it had the severity backwards.
//
// Node resolves ESM specifiers against a module's REALPATH (no --preserve-symlinks). So in
// a dev install every entry point is a symlink into the repo, and its `../lib/x.mjs`
// imports resolve inside the REPO — an absent `~/.qwen-mem-lite/lib/x.mjs` changes
// nothing. Verified on the maintainer's own machine: doctor reported
//
//   ⚠ Dev drift: 6 missing: lib/injected-ids.mjs, lib/time-constants.mjs, …
//     (re-run: node …/install.mjs install --dev)
//
// while every hook that imports those exact modules was demonstrably working, because
// readlink -f ~/.qwen-mem-lite/scripts/pre-tool-recall.js → the repo. A remedy was
// prescribed for a healthy install.
//
// In a COPY install (npm / plugin / `install` without --dev) the entry points are real
// files, so `../lib/x.mjs` resolves against the INSTALL DIR and a missing module is a hard
// ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND on every hook fire. That case produced NO doctor output at all:
// checkDevDrift returns devMode=false (devMode is "≥1 symlink"), and install.mjs gated
// both the warning AND the all-clear on devMode — so the shape where missing files are
// FATAL was the silent one. Same "gate the all-green string on every counter" rule (#8268)
// failing in the other direction.
//
// A hybrid install (symlinks + copied entry points) keeps the hard warning: a copied entry
// point does resolve against the install dir, so there the missing module can still bite.
