// Regression test for audit P1 #6: the SIGTERM/SIGINT shutdown handler wrote an
// ep-flush-* file that no worker consumes, so the in-flight episode was silently
// lost on abnormal termination. saveEpisodeImmediate — now also called from that
// handler before the flush-file write — persists a rule-based observation
// synchronously. Tested via the importable hook-llm seam (hook.mjs itself
// process.exit()s at import, so the handler can't be unit-imported directly).
