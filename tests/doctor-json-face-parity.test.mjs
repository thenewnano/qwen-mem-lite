// doctor renders the SAME diagnosis onto two faces, and the machine-readable one was the
// poorer of the two in two independent ways (R12 audit, partition C).
//
//   P2-3 — every remedy line goes through `log()`, and `log()` was a no-op under `--json`.
//          A `--json` consumer got `{level:'fail', message:'Database: file is not a database'}`
//          and nothing else, while the same run told a human to
//          `mv "…db" "…db.corrupt"`. Measured pre-fix: 7 of doctor's 16 `log(` sites carry a
//          runnable command; zero of them reached the JSON. (This file first said "12 of 14"
//          — pre-ship review recounted both halves. 16 is the count at the previous release
//          too, so nothing in this round moved it.)
//   P2-4 — four checks call `warn()` (pushing `level:'warn'`) and then `issues++`. So
//          `issues` counted rows that report themselves as warnings, and
//          `buildDoctorSummary`'s documented contract ("`issues` are ✗-level") was false in
//          shipped code. Measured pre-fix on the corrupt-DB fixture below:
//          issues=4 / fail-level=3, warnings=6 / warn-level=7. A CI wrapper doing
//          `checks.filter(c => c.level === 'fail')` — the stated reason `--json` exists —
//          under-reported by exactly the four escalated-warning checks.
//
// Both are asserted against the JSON face by comparing it to the human face of the SAME
// run-shape, so neither assertion pins doctor's wording.
