// A superseded row may keep decaying, but must never be auto-marked for PURGE.
//
// P3-13 asked a semantic question the 2026-09-02 audit deliberately left open: should
// tombstones (superseded_at set, compressed_into still 0) go through automatic GC? The
// answer is per-op, and only two ops have a consequence. Measured on the live DB
// 2026-09-04 (3779 observations, 31 superseded, 19 of them live tombstones):
//
//   boostAccessed / demotePinned / decayAndMarkIdle's DECAY arm — write `importance`
//     only, and importance is inert on a row every read path already filters out via
//     liveObsFilterSql. Including or excluding tombstones there is a behavioural no-op,
//     so they are deliberately NOT changed (and their forecasts stay untouched with them).
//   cleanupBroken — hard-deletes rows with no title, no narrative and no lesson. Left
//     alone, and this is an OPEN GAP, not a reasoned exemption: a tombstone reaching it
//     loses its redirect exactly as purgeStale would. An earlier draft of this comment
//     said "'broken' is true of a tombstone either way", which concedes the row carries
//     the redirect and then deletes it anyway — the pre-tag correctness review refuted it.
//     Not a regression (this has always been true), reachable population 0 today, and out
//     of the scope the adjudication authorised. Three paths hard-delete an observation,
//     two are guarded, this is the third.
//   decayAndMarkIdle's MARK-IDLE arm + search-scoring.runIdleCleanup's mark pass —
//     write COMPRESSED_PENDING_PURGE, which purgeStale then HARD-DELETES. That is the
//     one path with teeth, because deleting the row destroys `superseded_by`.
//
// 27 of those 31 superseded rows carry a usable `superseded_by`, and three functions in
// the Stop citation loop (applyCitationDecay / recordCitationSurfaces / bumpCitationAccess)
// route old ids through `redirectSupersededIds` to reach the successor. Purging the
// tombstone silently ends that: a `#NN` naming a corrected memory stops resolving.
//
// The precedent is in the same SQL statement. Lesson-bearing rows were exempted from
// mark-idle on exactly this reasoning — background machinery must not dispose of value it
// cannot regenerate, while an explicit `delete` still can. A tombstone's redirect is the
// same shape of value, and explicit `delete` still removes it.
//
// Exposure today is zero on all five ops, and that zero is NOT vacuous. Measured read-only
// 2026-09-04T17:05Z: all 19 live tombstones pass the `compressed_into = 0` conjunct, and it
// is the LATER conjuncts that exclude them — narrowly. One sits at injection_count = 12
// (past demotePinned's threshold of 8, held out only by cited_count), and 13 are above
// boostAccessed's access threshold, held out only by importance = 3, the lowest at exactly
// access_count = 4. Near misses, not impossibilities — which is why the guard goes in
// before the first hit. Stamped because they walk: hours earlier the same queries read 12.
