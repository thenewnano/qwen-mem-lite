// The `os` field in package.json is an npm INSTALL GATE, not a runtime check, and
// scripts/launch.mjs runs `npm install --omit=dev` on every first launch after a plugin
// update (Claude Code materializes each new cache version WITHOUT node_modules). So a
// platform missing from that list does not get a warning — it gets EBADPLATFORM, exit 1,
// a dead stdio server and `CONNECTION_CLOSED` in /mcp, with the launcher's catch block
// asserting three causes ("read-only directory, disk full, or network blocked") none of
// which is the real one. That is issue #28.
//
// The field was added in b6a2579 (R10 P3-19, first shipped v5.1.0) with the stated intent
// that "a Windows user should be told rather than handed a string of silent catch blocks".
// Blocking the install is the opposite of telling: the user learns nothing and loses the
// MCP server, which is Node-only and runs fine (better-sqlite3 13 ships win32-x64 and
// win32-arm64 prebuilds).
//
// Two things are pinned here. (1) `platformAllowed` reproduces npm's OWN checkList
// semantics, negation included — a hand-rolled `list.includes(platform)` disagrees with
// npm on `["!win32"]` and would make the launcher's diagnosis wrong in the one direction
// that matters. (2) The gate runs BEFORE npm, proven behaviourally: the blocked run must
// leave no node_modules behind.
