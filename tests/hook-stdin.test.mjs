// Audit 2026-09-02 P1-9. Six hook processes read the host payload off stdin, six ways.
// Three were bounded at three different calibers; three were an unbounded
// `for await (const chunk of process.stdin) input += chunk` with no cap and no timeout.
//
// The unbounded three are the ones with a cost. `PreToolUse:Write` carries the ENTIRE file
// being written in `tool_input.content`, so `pre-tool-recall.js` buffered and `JSON.parse`d
// multiple megabytes in order to read `file_path`. The only bound was the host's own ~3 s
// fail-open, which from the outside is indistinguishable from the hook having nothing to say.
//
// Two things are asserted here and they are different claims:
//   1. the shared reader BEHAVES (cap, timeout, settle-once);
//   2. the five entry points that should use it DO, and the sixth deliberately does not.
// A behavioural test alone stays green while a caller keeps its private copy, which is the
// state this consolidation exists to end.
