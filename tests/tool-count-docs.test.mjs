// R10 P2-19 — the tool counts in the docs are DERIVED, so derive them.
//
// Five places stated a tool count and three different answers were in circulation:
// README.md said 20 total / 11 hidden, README.zh-CN.md said 17 total / 6 core / 11 hidden,
// llms.txt said 20 / 11, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md said 9 listed + 11 hidden — while
// tool-schemas.mjs has said 18 = 9 + 9 since v5.0.0 removed mem_use and mem_registry.
// README's own hidden-tool table had nine rows the whole time, under a heading saying
// eleven, which is what makes a hand-maintained count worth replacing rather than
// re-correcting: it had already disagreed with the table directly beneath it.
//
// tests/tool-schemas.test.mjs carries a comment asking that CLAUDE.md be updated in the
// same PR as a tool-count change. This is that request, enforced, and widened to the four
// user-facing docs.
