// TOP_REL_FLOOR (50) and OR_TOP_BM25_FLOOR (30) gate a quantity that carries an
// FTS5 IDF term (≈ ln(N/df)), so the SAME row scores higher on a bigger index.
// Measured on one fixed query + target while padding the corpus with distinct
// filler (2026-08-13 dogfood): |bm25| 10.0 @ N=10 → 18.6 @ 40 → 24.2 @ 100 →
// 30.7 @ 300. The floors were calibrated at 584 obs, so on a new install they
// reject every hit — a realistic first-day corpus scored 0/8 injections.
//
// corpusFloorScale() restores scale-invariance by dividing the corpus's max
// attainable IDF — FTS5's `log((N - df + 0.5) / (df + 0.5))` at df=1 — by the
// reference corpus's, capped at 1. The cap is the safety property: established
// installs must be untouched.
//
// The 2026-08-17 e2e round replaced the first cut's ln(N+1)/ln(N_REF+1) ramp, which decayed far too
// slowly at small N and left a first-week corpus silent below ~5 rows. The
// end-to-end consequence is pinned in tests/ups-cold-start-injection.test.mjs;
// this suite covers the scale's structural properties only. Deliberately NOT
// asserted here: the closed form at any single N. Mirroring the formula in the test
// makes the test agree with whatever the code says, which is how the wrong ramp
// stayed green.
