 * guarded — by the subprocess cases in tests/pre-tool-recall.test.mjs, which
 * drive the real script — not by anything in this helper. The `importance`
 * column it selects is likewise helper-only: the shipped injection query never
 * returns it (D#163).
 *

 * caller and was deleted 2026-08-22. The twin split basenames on either
 * separator while the shipped pair used host-native `basename`, so a real

 * keeps every caller on the shipped MATCH clause instead of re-deriving it per
 * suite — the twin-drift class this repo has re-opened repeatedly.

 * 5000 was not. Measured on this host: an MCP `initialize` round trip against a cold

 * 7.9x margin — and the cap still lost once in five full-suite runs, on 24 cores with 311

 * which is the same "green depends on host load" defect class as the audit's MAIN-1 and

/**
 * Remove a `mkdtempSync` fixture directory: retried, and loud when it fails.
 *
 * D#2. One measured run of the four leaking suites left 11 dirs in /tmp — attributed by
 * NAME SET, not by subtracting counts: mem-cooldown 5, mem-usertyped 4, mem-ssenv 1,
 * mem-audit-t4-stop 1. Two distinct causes, and neither was "the test forgot an afterEach":
 *
 *   1. DETERMINISTIC (cooldown, usertyped — 9 of the 11, now 0). The afterEach removed the
 *      wrong path: one wrapped `mkdtempSync(...)` in `join(root, 'runtime')` and disposed
 *      only the child, the other built a fresh dir per helper call and kept no reference.
 *   2. RECREATION AFTER DISPOSAL (ssenv, t4-stop — 2 of the 11, still 2 by design).
 *      Removal SUCCEEDS, then a detached worker of the hook subprocess re-runs
 *      resolveDataDir against the HOME it was handed — the path just deleted — and
 *      recreates `.qwen-mem-lite/runtime` plus a fresh 274KB DB. Identified by shape:
 *      the fixture's own subdirs (`work/`, `audit/`) never come back, only the data dir.
 *      lib/tmp-fixture-sweep.mjs absorbs this class via its `mem-` prefix (:24) and
 *      DEFAULT_FIXTURE_AGE_MS (:51) — NOT the R10 P2-18 comment at :40-45, which is about
 *      three unrelated prefixes; an earlier draft cited those lines in three places.
 *
 * `maxRetries` here is DEFENSIVE, not the fix for either cause above: Node documents it
 * as the remedy for ENOTEMPTY / EBUSY / EPERM / EMFILE / ENFILE, `force: true` covers only
 * ENOENT, and the default retry count is 0. No leak in this repo has been measured to that
 * errno — do not cite it as one.
 *
 * The bare `catch {}` these sites used is the reason the leak survived: a failure that
 * recurred on every run was indistinguishable from success. This reports instead.
 *
 * @param {string|undefined|null} dir absolute path; nullish is a no-op (a beforeEach that
 *   threw before assigning leaves the variable undefined, and the afterEach still runs).
 * @param {object} [opts]
 * @param {(p: string, o: object) => void} [opts.rm] injected remover, for this helper's
 *   own tests. Production callers pass nothing.

/**
 * Collect fixture dirs and re-dispose them once, at the END of the test FILE.
 *
 * This is the RECREATION half of D#2, and it needs a different hook than the deterministic
 * half `disposeFixtureDir` above serves. Measured 2026-09-07 on `main` @ v5.3.0, whole
 * suite, attributed by NAME SET and then by instrumented creation site — not by subtracting
 * counts: one clean `npx vitest run` (360 files / 5730 passed, exit 0) left **30** of this
 * repo's fixture dirs in /tmp, plus one `ssr/` dir belonging to vite itself.
 * `tests/e2e.test.mjs` alone accounted for 13 of the 30, all from ONE creation site (its
 * top-level `beforeEach`), and the rest were integration-scenarios 5, adoption-replay 5, and
 * six suites leaking exactly 1 each.
 *
 * The mechanism is NOT a failed removal, so do not "fix" it by retrying the afterEach:
 * instrumenting the afterEach recorded 71 invocations, `rmSync` threw **zero** times, and
 * `existsSync` was **false** immediately after every one of them — yet 12 of those paths
 * existed again when the file finished. A detached worker of a hook subprocess re-runs
 * `resolveDataDir` against the HOME it was handed, which the test has since deleted, and
 * recreates it. The shape confirms it and is worth keeping as the diagnostic: a recreated
 * dir holds ONLY `.qwen-mem-lite/` (db + `runtime/`), never the fixture's own subdirs —
 * `beforeEach` also makes `parent/testproj/`, and that never comes back.
 *
 * `afterAll` is late enough: the same instrumentation saw all 13 alive at that point. That
 * is the whole reason this exists rather than more retries. It does NOT replace
 * `lib/tmp-fixture-sweep.mjs` — a worker can still recreate a dir after `afterAll`, and the
 * 1h sweeper at the next run's globalSetup remains the backstop for that and for SIGKILL.
 * What it buys is that a clean run stops leaving residue behind at all, which is what makes
 * the CLAUDE.md §7 residue count usable as a gate: today a real leak is indistinguishable
 * from 30 dirs of expected background.
 *
 * Disposal is by IDENTITY — the list of paths this file created — never by prefix or mtime.
 * A run-scoped sweep keyed on "created after this run started" would delete a concurrently
 * running suite's in-flight fixtures, which is exactly the collateral-deletion risk
 * `lib/tmp-fixture-sweep.mjs` refuses to take (see its allowlist comment).
 *
 * Deliberately takes no vitest import: `benchmark/*.mjs`, `eslint.config.mjs` and
 * `hook-memory.mjs` all import this module outside a vitest context, so a top-level
 * `import { afterAll } from 'vitest'` here would break them. The caller registers the hook.
 *
 * @example
 *   const fixtures = makeFixtureTracker();
 *   afterAll(() => fixtures.disposeAll());
 *   beforeEach(() => { tmpHome = fixtures.track(makeTmpDir()); });
 *
 * @returns {{track: (dir: string) => string, disposeAll: () => number}} `track` returns its
 *   argument so it can wrap a creation call inline; `disposeAll` returns how many dirs it
 *   could not remove (0 when clean) and empties the list.
