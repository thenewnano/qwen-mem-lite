// A remedy doctor prints has to be a command the reader can actually run.
//
// On a HOME with no qwen-mem-lite deployed, doctor said:
//
//   Hook scripts: <home>/.qwen-mem-lite/scripts is absent — ... Fix: qwen-mem-lite
//   self-update (or: node <home>/.qwen-mem-lite/cli.mjs repair)
//
// `cli.mjs` is one of the files whose absence produced that verdict, so the alternative it
// offers cannot start. The managed-files check carries the same remedy and reaches the same
// state as soon as anything creates the data dir.
//
// The root of it is that `!shape.managed` conflates two populations with OPPOSITE remedies:
// an install that was DAMAGED (some entry points survive — `repair` is exactly right) and
// one that was never deployed here at all (`repair` has nothing to run from; the user needs
// `install`). install.mjs:2367 records the same conflation being fixed once already, for
// plugin-only installs — a third state was still missing.
//
// The first case below is deliberately a general invariant rather than a wording check:
// ANY remedy naming `node <path> repair` must name a path that exists. It therefore covers
// checks not written yet, and does not have to be edited when the prose changes.
