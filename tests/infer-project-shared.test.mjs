// scripts/pre-tool-recall.js must derive the SAME project string as the save path.
//
// Recall queries the project that observations were SAVED under, so the two derivations
// have to agree byte-for-byte. pre-tool-recall.js used to carry a hand-kept copy of the
// six lines, and that copy had already drifted once — it omitted the process.env.PWD
// fallback, so under a symlinked project dir (PWD = logical path, cwd = resolved) with
// CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR unset it computed a DIFFERENT project than the save path and
// silently recalled nothing. It now imports the shared implementation; this pins that
// the two stay one implementation rather than two that happen to match today.
//
// Context: a git-work-tree anchoring change was written and REVERTED before shipping (it
// split the namespace for sessions rooted below the repo root — see the inferProject
// doc comment). The revert is why this file tests the invariant rather than the walk.
