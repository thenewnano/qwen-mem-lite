// task_imperative as a METERED face (v3.76).
//
// The imperative line — `Memory — a past lesson applies to THIS task. You must: … (#NN)`
// — has been a live injection since v3.23 and was never counted. It rides the SAME
// attachment as the `<memory-context>` block (both are stdout writes from one
// `hook.mjs user-prompt` invocation), which is why it could hide: the `ups` matcher
// gates on `<memory-context` and collects only `- [` rows, so the imperative row was
// walked past on every Stop. With no row in citation_surface_log, D#137-shaped questions
// ("is the imperative framing earning its budget?") could only be answered by offline
// replay, and D#150/D#151 are blocked on the same missing denominator.
//
// The two faces overlap by construction — one attachment, two rows — which is the
// documented per-face VIEW semantics, not a partition. What must NOT happen is
// cross-contamination: neither face may collect the other's ids.
