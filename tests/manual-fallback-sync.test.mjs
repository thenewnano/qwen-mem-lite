// The manual recovery one-liner lives on THREE surfaces and cannot be shared by import:
// scripts/hook-launcher.mjs is under a pure-`node:` charter (it must survive a broken
// install), and README.md is documentation. install.mjs owns the value; this pins the
// other two to it, and fails if a fourth surface starts carrying its own.
//
// Same mechanism as tests/audit-r8-binding-repair-hint.test.mjs, for the same reason: a
// string kept in sync by a comment is a string that drifts. It drifted here already — all
// of them carried `/tarball`, which serves the DEFAULT BRANCH (unreleased WIP), while the
// prose beside two of them promised "in sync with the latest release".
