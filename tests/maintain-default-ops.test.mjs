// v3.76.0: the automatic maintenance path promoted and never demoted.
//
// `demotePinned` (injection_count>=8 AND cited_count=0 -> importance floored: no lesson
// to 1, lesson-bearing to 2) is the only op
// that can reach a heavily-injected-but-uncited row — the regular decay op deliberately
// protects injection_count>0, on the theory that a row Claude was shown 8 times is
// contextually proven. But demote_pinned was in NO face's default op set, and hook.mjs
// did not even import it, so it ran only when a human typed `--ops demote_pinned`. Its
// opponent `boostAccessed` (access_count>3 -> importance+1) was in all three faces.
//
// Measured on the maintainer's live DB before this fix: 148 rows demoted by citation
// decay, never cited, and back at importance>=3 — 148/148 of them boost-eligible. Plus
// 17 rows sitting demote-eligible right then, carrying 265 recorded injections.
//
// READ THOSE TWO NUMBERS AS SEPARATE POPULATIONS, not as a before/after pair. The
// original wording put the 148 in the headline slot, which invites "this fix repairs
// 148 rows"; it does not. `boostAccessed` triggers on access_count, `demotePinned` on
// injection_count>=8, and the overlap is thin. Re-measured 2026-08-22 on the same DB:
// 178 rows now match the decayed/never-cited/back-at-3 shape, 152 of them boost-eligible
// — but only **7** are reachable by demotePinned (94 sit at injection_count=0, 77 at
// 1-7). So this op closes the loop for the heavily-injected tail, and the far larger
// access-driven population it does NOT touch is a separate, still-open question.
// Un-narrowable on current data, and deliberately so: injection_count is bumped only on
// the two query-conditioned UserPromptSubmit faces because scoring-sql.mjs reads it as a
// NOISE signal, and v3.66.1 already reverted an attempt to widen it (D#124).
//
// The two faces that DID wire the op ran it in OPPOSITE orders, and the order is
// load-bearing: mem-cli demoted then boosted, handing the row straight back (1 -> 2);
// server.mjs boosted then demoted (row lands at 1). So a fixture must be able to tell
// those two apart, which is why the seed row below is importance **2**, not 3:
//
//   importance 3 seed -> boostAccessed requires importance<3, so boost is a no-op and
//   the ordering mutation stays GREEN. The case would only prove "demote ran at all".
//   importance 2 seed -> correct order (boost 2->3, demote ->1) ends at 1
//                        wrong order   (demote ->1, boost 1->2) ends at 2
//                        opt-out       (boost 2->3, no demote)  ends at 3
//
// Three distinguishable terminal values, so every mutation this file is meant to catch
// changes an asserted number.
