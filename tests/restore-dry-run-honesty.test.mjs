// `restore --dry-run` must not report work it did not do.
//
// The summary line was shared verbatim between the real and preview runs:
//
//   [mem] Restore (dry-run): 10 restored, 0 duplicate(s) skipped, 0 malformed/failed …
//
// Past-tense "restored" for a run that wrote nothing, on the one command whose entire job is
// to let a user check a backup BEFORE trusting it. Worse, the count can exceed the real
// outcome: the preview applies the durable exact-dup guard (project+title+created_at) but not
// saveObservation's Jaccard near-duplicate collapse, which only exists on the writing path.
// Measured on a backup holding two same-titled weekly summaries: previewed 10, restored 9.
//
// That collapse was the defect, not the preview (E2E round 2026-09-29): a backup's rows all
// coexisted in the source store, so restore has nothing to deduplicate but rows the target
// already holds (the exact project+title+created_at guard). With the near-duplicate window —
// which restore ran with a PAST `now` and so no upper bound — 25 distinct `--force`d rows
// restored into an empty store as 1, and an old backup row was dropped for resembling a
// newer live row. Restore now saves with `force`, so the preview is the outcome.
