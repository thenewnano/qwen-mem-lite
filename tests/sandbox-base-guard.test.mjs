// tests/sandbox-base-guard.test.mjs — guards tests/sandbox/sbx-base.mjs, which decides
// where the install harness is allowed to build a sandbox root.
//
// The harness itself is NOT part of `vitest run` (real `npm i -g`, real network, minutes),
// so without this file its only guard would run on a machine nobody watches. What is
// asserted here is the refusal, in both directions: a base under HOME must throw, and a
// base outside it must be returned unchanged. A guard with only the positive half is one
// `if (false)` away from green — this repo has shipped that shape before.
//
// The case that motivated it is real and was found by RUNNING the harness: `os.tmpdir()`
// reads `$TMPDIR`, a Claude Code session sets `$TMPDIR` to `~/.claude/tmp/claude-<uid>`,
// and `/home/<user>/node_modules` on this machine holds both `better-sqlite3` and
// `qwen-mem-lite`. So the harness's documented default put its sandbox under HOME —
// exactly what its README forbids, forty lines further down in a section the quickstart
// reader never reaches — and every check still passed, against the wrong install tree.
