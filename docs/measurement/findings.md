# Architecture findings — full record

Verbatim detail for the invariants summarised in CLAUDE.md's **Invariants that bite**
section. Moved out of CLAUDE.md 2026-09-05; byte-identical to v3.95.0 (commit ca1881b).

Each of these was expensive to establish and at least one shipped as a WRONG draft
first. The one-line rule in CLAUDE.md is the load-bearing part; the evidence is here.

## PostToolUse does not fire on host-flagged failures

- **`PostToolUse` does NOT fire for a tool call the host marks as failed.** Claude Code delivers those to a *separate* event, `PostToolUseFailure`, **registered since v3.79.0 (D#170)** — before that, `error_recall` was structurally blind to every host-flagged failure and the only "failures" it ever saw were commands that exited **0** while printing error-ish text (the classic shape being `cmd 2>&1 | tail`, where the pipe launders a failure into a success). Verified two independent ways on 2026-08-24: the host bundle 2.1.241 lists `PostToolUseFailure` alongside `PostToolUse` in its event enum with schema in `{hook_event_name, tool_name, tool_input, tool_use_id, error, is_interrupt?, duration_ms?}` / out `{hookEventName, additionalContext?}` — **the failure text is in `error`, there is no `tool_response`**, and `additionalContext` is the injection channel; and a live probe (two genuinely failing Bash calls, one with a full stack frame) left **zero** trace in the episode buffer and the `events` table while the successful calls either side of it were recorded. **Do not try to fix this class by widening `HARD_ERROR_RE`** — that was D#151's plan and every anchor it named (`panicked`/segfault/tsc/gcc/make/go-test/cargo-test/docker/kubectl) measured **zero** gain over 1110 real transcripts, because 89.1% of missed failures never reach that regex at all. Still true and still load-bearing: `hooks/hooks.json` and `install.mjs`'s direct `settings.json` entries are **two separate hook sets** that must be changed together (`tests/audit-silent-20260814.test.mjs` diffs them and is verified binding). The failure path deliberately does **not** feed the episode buffer — episode entries flow into LLM summarisation and the save-nudge, whose behaviour under an influx of failures is unmeasured — and it gates on `lib/tool-refusal.mjs`, because **68.9% of host-flagged Bash failures on this machine are the agent's own guardrails refusing**, not programs failing. Off switch: `CLAUDE_MEM_ERROR_RECALL_ON_FAILURE=off`.

## A SQL LIMIT upstream of a JS relevance filter is a reachability bound

- **A SQL `LIMIT` upstream of a JS-side relevance filter is a REACHABILITY bound, not a ranking bound.** `rankImperativeCandidates` (hook-memory.mjs) selects `importance >= 2 ORDER BY importance DESC, created_at DESC, id DESC LIMIT n`, then filters by identifier overlap **in JS**. At `n = 50` the `task_imperative` and `subagent` faces could only ever pick from the 50 newest high-importance rows, and in five projects here the `importance = 3` population alone exceeds that — so every `importance = 2` lesson was unreachable however well it matched, and a citation-decay demotion `3 -> 2` **evicted** a row instead of down-ranking it (D#172's filed risk). Now `IMPERATIVE_POOL_BACKSTOP = 5000`, documented at the constant as an OOM backstop and explicitly not a relevance gate; **and since D#179/D#198 citation-decay no longer writes `importance` at all, so neither a `3 -> 2` nor a `2 -> 1` walk can originate there any more — that whole eviction class is closed from the other end, not just widened around. What still moves `importance` automatically along a CITATION path is the `boost` maintain op via `access_count` (D#206, open — and gated since v3.84.0. **The "≤3 of 52 eligible rows" bound this sentence used to carry is RETRACTED as of R11 / v5.6.0, and there is no replacement**: it was computed as "one citation contributes at most 1", and `Stop` fires once per assistant TURN while rescanning the whole transcript, so before `observations.last_access_session_id` one citation contributed once per remaining turn of its session — 338 credits over 43 distinct (session, id) pairs = 7.86× across 51 real transcripts. The premise holds going forward only; `access_count` values written before v5.6.0 are an upper bound, not a count, and were not back-corrected. See the Key Context bullet, whose copy of the same figure carries the same retraction). Automatic movement not driven by citations continues regardless: `decayAndMarkIdle`, `demotePinned`, `recoverBuriedLessons`, `autoBoostIfNeeded`.** Historically: `3 -> 2` was a down-rank again after the widening, while `2 -> 1` remained an eviction (the pool gate is `>= 2`) on a face that only now reaches `importance = 2` rows at all. **Count that population with the pool's OWN `liveObsFilterSql`**, never a bare `WHERE importance = 3`: the filtered figures are projects--mem 327 / code-graph-mcp 121 / ubuntu-sec 56 / daagu 53 / agentsmd 51, and the raw ones (365 / 131 / 62 / 69 / 51) include superseded and compressed rows the pool can never return — v3.82.0 shipped a first draft that published the raw column and overstated one project by a third. **Ruler: `node benchmark/imperative-pool-replay.mjs`** (`--population` for just the pool sizes). It replays real user prompts against their own project's corpus, cross-checks its own query against the shipped function before reporting, and **attacks the superset/monotonicity argument on every prompt, exiting non-zero on a counterexample**. Current: 7 of 85 picks destroyed by the old bound, top-1 changed in 3 of 78, 0.44 -> 1.50 ms/prompt, 0 counterexamples. **`benchmark/denoise-ab.mjs` is structurally blind to this face** (its suites are query→document FTS; this is prompt→lesson identifier overlap), so a NEUTRAL Δ=0 there says nothing about it.

## The cross-hook injected-ids marker is a union across tables

- **The cross-hook injected-ids marker is a union across TABLES, and every table but one already had a prefix.** `user-prompt-search.js` writes `P<id>` for `user_prompts` rows and `D<id>` for `deferred` rows with the comment "so obs ids can't collide in the shared injected-ids file"; observations are the incumbent namespace and stay bare. `events` never got one — and `events` is the table that literally shares the id space with `observations` (**91.6%** of observation ids also exist as an event id — 3432 of 3747, measured 2026-09-01T19:56Z; it read 90.1% six hours earlier, so stamp it, both tables grow). So a UPS-injected observation #42 made event #42 unreachable to the PreToolUse face for the 5-minute window, and vice versa. **A second consequence was published in v3.86.0's draft and is FALSE, kept here because the draft's method was "enumerate the readers"**: bare event ids do reach `hook.mjs`'s `pathAInjectedIds`, which is handed to `searchRelevantMemories` and `rankImperativeCandidates` as an OBSERVATION exclude list — but they suppress nothing, because `mergeCrossHookInjected` writes every id as a STRING while both consumers test `new Set(excludeIds).has(r.id)` against a NUMBER out of SQLite (measured: excluding `1` returns nothing, excluding `'1'` returns the row). That inertness is a separate live defect that covers observations too → **D#213**, which replaced D#212, which replaced D#193 — the entry was rewritten twice because the first two versions measured the marker's **writer** instead of its reader. The marker is written by `user-prompt-search.js` (the `fyi` face) and `pre-tool-recall.js` (`pretool`) and read in `hook.mjs handleUserPrompt` (the `ups` face), so the gated population is `ups ∩ (fyi ∪ pretool)`: upper bound **9.0%** — 23 of 256 (session, id) pairs over 14 of 71 sessions, 99 transcripts, 2026-09-02T12:12Z — and **not** the mirror-image 18.0% a v3.89.0 draft published. It stays open rather than fixed because this path already has a suppressor that DOES work (`shouldSkipByDedup` String-normalises both sides), so turning the per-row exclude on adds a second, finer suppression to an already-suppressed face in an unknown direction; the blocker is a ruler, since rebuilding a per-prompt exclude set needs the marker file, which rotates and is never persisted. `tests/pathA-exclude-inert.test.mjs` pins the current inert behaviour — delete it as part of any fix. A third consumer the draft missed in the opposite direction: `shouldSkipByDedup` DOES String-normalise both sides, so a colliding bare event id could push its overlap ratio past 0.8 and skip an entire UPS injection — namespacing fixes that as well. Measured by replaying every real session's UPS-injected id set against the injectable events of **the project the SESSION ran in**: **14 collisions in 11 of 60 sessions (18.3%)**, 2026-09-01T20:17Z. **Which project is the whole question, and v3.86.0's draft got it wrong inside a paragraph about populations**: `pre-tool-recall.js` calls `inferProject()` ONCE and feeds that one value to both `crossHookInjectedFile(project, sessionId)` and the events `WHERE project = ?`, so the session's project is the scoping that exists. The draft scoped by the injected observation's own `project` column instead and published **9 in 9 (15.5%)**, an under-count. **Not a rounding difference: 134 of 216 injected `ups` ids (62.0%) belong to a project OTHER than the session they were injected into** (2026-09-01T20:36Z; the review read 128/210 = 61% an hour earlier). The `ups` face's cross-project leg dominates, so the two scopings select genuinely different populations and only one of them is a question the dedup mechanism ever asks. The pre-tag claims review reconstructed the session-scoped reading independently at 12 in 10 and was right about the population; the residual gap to 14/11 is its stand-in directory→project mapping plus an hour of corpus growth. The predicate, stated because no harness is committed: seen-set = the shipped `extractInjectedBySurface(path).ups`; injectable events = `importance >= 2 AND superseded_at_epoch IS NULL AND file_paths NOT IN (NULL, '[]')`; session project recovered by a FORWARD match of each DB project against the transcript directory suffix (the reverse map is not invertible — `/` and `_` both flatten to `-`, and a reverse guess left 24 of 60 sessions unmapped, silently counting them as zero). Dropping the project condition entirely gives **72 in 41** — a population the project-scoped query can never reach, so state which one any figure came from. Fixed via `injectedIdKey(id, src)` in `lib/injected-ids.mjs` (`E<id>` for events); legacy in-flight files keep their old meaning for at most `DEDUP_STALE_MS` and then rotate, deliberately with no format version. D#188.

## The suite gave its hooks half the budget it gave its tests (D#7)

Evidence for the `hookTimeout` alignment, preserved here because **the run conclusion no
longer carries it**: run `34084390501` was re-run and now reads `success` in
`gh run list`, so the only surviving record of the red is attempt 1's job log, and
GitHub expires those. Pulled 2026-09-07 from
`repos/:owner/:repo/actions/jobs/101625623151/logs` (attempt 1, `test (22)`,
conclusion **failure** per the API — the other eight jobs of that attempt were green,
including `test (24)` and `test (26)`).

Verbatim from the log:

    FAIL tests/session-start-stdout-envelope.test.mjs > SessionStart stdout envelope
         > emits one JSON document when the memory block and the dashboard both have content
    Error: Hook timed out in 10000ms.
    If this is a long-running hook, pass a timeout value as the last argument or
    configure it globally with "hookTimeout".
     ❯ tests/session-start-stdout-envelope.test.mjs:106:3
       106|   beforeEach(() => {

Four things that log settles, none of which were established when D#7 was filed:

1. **It is `beforeEach` (:106), not the `afterEach` teardown.** That hook does
   `mkdtempSync` + two `mkdirSync` + `new Database` + `journal_mode = WAL` +
   `initSchema` + close — real I/O, not a hang.
2. **`hookTimeout` appears NOWHERE in this repo.** `vitest.config.mjs` sets
   `testTimeout: 20000` and leaves hooks on vitest's 10000 default, so the asymmetry was
   never a decision — it is an unexamined default, and vitest's own error text names the
   knob.
3. **The magnitude the "load, not logic" hypothesis was missing.** That file reports
   **14736 ms** in the failing CI run against **1.02 s** locally for the same six cases —
   14.4x. Worker startup on the runner read **~129 ms** each (`at least ~15.48s faster
   with isolate: false`) against ~89 ms locally. `ci.yml:106` runs `npm run test:coverage`
   for the whole `[22, 24, 26]` matrix, so every arm carries the instrumentation.
4. **The exposure is the suite, not the file.** Heuristic scan of `before*`/`after*`
   bodies for `mkdtempSync|new Database|execFileSync|execSync|rmSync|initSchema`:
   **153 of 362 test files**. (Crude brace-matcher — read it as a magnitude. The claim
   does not rest on it: `hookTimeout` being absent does.)

So raising it is not papering over a red — it is making the config state a decision the
project already made for the same class of work. **What the log does NOT establish is
the cause of that particular red**, and Node 24 / 26 passing the same run under the same
instrumentation is unexplained; do not invent a mechanism for it. D#7 stays OPEN as an
observation-until-recurrence, and the structural asymmetry being gone is what makes a
recurrence informative rather than ambiguous.

## Skill recommendation (shadow-first) — REMOVED 2026-09

The whole skill-registry subsystem (recommendation engine, PreToolUse Skill bridge, resource
registry) was deleted in R9 — see `docs/audits/20260906-145304.md` for the evidence and
`CHANGELOG.md` for the migration note. Kept here because the *measurement* lessons outlive
the code:

- The engine ran shadow-only for 74 days and logged **0** recommendation rows, because every
  runtime path gated on a `resource-registry.db` that the plugin install channel never created.
  A subsystem can be fully wired, fully tested, and still never execute — the shadow log's own
  emptiness was the finding, and nothing in the test suite could have reported it.
- Its Phase-2 flip criterion (lift > 1 on session-matched precision) was **not computable**:
  `resource-discovery` named rows `plugin/skill` while the Skill tool passes `plugin:skill`,
  and the scanner never wrote `invocation_name`. v3.12.1 had already "fixed" that join once.
  A gate waiting on a number its own instrumentation cannot produce is a deadlock, not a to-do.
- Removing it surfaced two guards that were green and blind: a `mem_registry` case whose
  assertion sat behind an `if` the error text could never satisfy, and a schema suite testing
  zod objects no surface registered any more. Deleting a subsystem is a good way to find the
  tests that were only ever agreeing with it.

# Moved from CLAUDE.md 2026-09-08 at v6.5.0

CLAUDE.md was capped at 20 KB so it stops consuming session context. Everything below is
**verbatim** from it — not rewritten, not summarised. CLAUDE.md keeps the one-line RULE and
points here for the evidence, which inverts that file's own standing doctrine ("a rule that
only exists in the appendix is a rule most sessions will never load"). That trade was made
deliberately and by instruction; the cost is that these are now appendix-only, so **read this
file before any retrieval, measurement, release or schema work.**

## Commands — native binding, heal chain and sandbox harness

_Verbatim from CLAUDE.md lines 37-121 at v6.5.0._

`claude-mem-lite help` for flags. **`rebuild-binding` is the fix for a missing native
binding**, and **v4.0.0 changed what it is fixing** — do not carry the old paragraph forward.
better-sqlite3 12 shipped `"install": "prebuild-install || node-gyp rebuild --release"`, so
npm 12's default script block left it with no `.node` at all; that was the whole -32000 class.
**13 has NO install script** and ships `prebuilds/<platform>.node` instead, for 8 platforms
(linux / linuxmusl / darwin / win32 × x64 / arm64). Measured: `npm install --ignore-scripts
better-sqlite3@13` lands 8 prebuilds and opens a DB; the same install of 12 lands none and
cannot. So on any covered platform the script block no longer reaches users at all.

The trap moved rather than vanished. **`npm rebuild better-sqlite3` exits 0 printing
"rebuilt dependencies successfully" while compiling nothing — and
`--dangerously-allow-all-scripts` does not change that.** Re-measured 2026-09-06 in a
`mktemp` sandbox on npm 12.0.2, both prebuild states: present → both forms leave
`build/Release/*.node` empty; deleted → both forms leave `new Database(':memory:')` throwing.
On a platform 13 ships no prebuild for, that makes the whole heal chain a silent no-op.

**Do not restate the reason as "there is no script to allow" — that was the v4.0.0 wording
and it is wrong.** `npm install-scripts ls` reports `better-sqlite3@13.0.3 (install: node-gyp
rebuild)` **blocked because not covered by allowScripts**, on npm 11.19.0 *and* 12.0.2, for a
package that declares no install script in its tarball `package.json`, the registry packument,
or the lockfile entry — npm synthesizes one. So npm's script block does still reach this
dependency; what saves a covered platform is the shipped prebuild, not a missing script. Two
things are measured and unexplained, so do not invent a mechanism for either: that report
flips to "No packages with unreviewed install scripts" when `prebuilds/` alone is deleted
(same tree, same lockfile, `binding.gyp` present both ways), and `npm rebuild` compiles
nothing even in the state where npm says the script exists and is blocked.

`ensureBetterSqlite3Working` therefore has a third step since v4.0.0: when the npm path exits
clean but the binding is still dead, it runs the package's own
`npm run --prefix node_modules/better-sqlite3 build-release` (13 still ships `src/`, `deps/`
and `binding.gyp`), and reports `action: 'compiled'`. Both halves are pinned in CI by the two
legs of `smoke-npm12`.

**Never hand a human `NATIVE_BINDING_REBUILD_CMD` on its own** — that is step 1 of the heal
chain, not a repair. Since v4.0.1 every user-facing hint goes through
`nativeBindingRepairHint()`, which sequences both commands with `&&` and **never `||`**:
step 1 exits 0 whether or not it compiled, so an `||` fallback can never fire. Two surfaces
duplicate the string because they may not import `lib/` (`scripts/hook-launcher.mjs`'s
pure-`node:` charter, `scripts/setup.sh`); both are pinned to the constants by
`tests/audit-r8-binding-repair-hint.test.mjs`, which also fails if a fourth surface starts
hardcoding it.

`doctor --metrics` is the only reader for the `inject` metric series (plain `doctor` omits it).

**Sandbox install harness** (not in `vitest run`; real `npm i -g` + real MCP stdio, minutes +
network): `SBX_BASE=/tmp/claude/sbx node tests/sandbox/phaseA-plugin.mjs` / `phaseB-npm.mjs` /
`phaseC-update.mjs`, one at a time — see `tests/sandbox/README.md`. **Run it after any
dependency major**: from v4.0.0 to v5.1.0 both self-heal sections corrupted
`build/Release/better_sqlite3.node`, a better-sqlite3 **12** path, so they measured nothing —
phase B's eight self-heal checks sat behind an `if (existsSync(…))` and silently stopped
running. Each phase now asserts its own check count (`EXPECTED_CHECKS`, 47 / 56 / 15), and
`tests/sandbox/lib.mjs::loadedBindingPath` asks better-sqlite3 which addon it would load
instead of naming one. **`SBX_BASE` is not
optional**: the fallback `$TMPDIR` lands under `$HOME`, and Node resolves `node_modules` up
the tree, so on a machine whose `~/node_modules` holds `better-sqlite3` the run silently
measures the home tree and passes anyway. The harness now refuses such a base.

**Last run: 2026-09-07, `fix/r10-p1-1-session-lifecycle` @ 5.3.1, Node v26.8.1 / npm
11.19.0 — 47/47, 56/56, 15/15, all three exit 0, each phase's tally matching its own
`EXPECTED_CHECKS`.** Phase B grew two sections and **both were written to fail first**:

- **B9 reproduced R10-P2-11 and it is now fixed.** With a marketplace clone AND a populated
  plugin cache present, `install` came back having overwritten the `3.95.0` cache dir's
  `scripts/launch.mjs` with the installer's own (9802 B), leaving that version calling
  `nativeBindingRepairHint` — an export its own `lib/binding-probe.mjs` does not have. The
  sync is now gated on `isDev || ver === selfVersion` and writes atomically; three of the
  checks are CI-side too, in `tests/install-e2e.test.mjs`, mutation-verified against the
  real revert.
- **B10 did NOT reproduce R10-P2-12, at 229 overlapping fires.** Four parallel launcher
  loops against five back-to-back in-place installs put **229 of 480 fires inside the
  2524 ms window**, with no `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, no non-zero exit and no new
  `runtime/hook-errors/` bytes. The mechanism R10 describes is unchanged — `install()`
  still copies in place with no swap barrier, while `hook-update.mjs` takes one — so read
  this as a bounded negative, not an acquittal, and note the bound: an idempotent
  re-install deploys the SAME module set, so it cannot produce the version-transition
  shape (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`) the report names. Producing that needs an install whose
  tree differs from the one on disk. `install()` was left alone per R10 §8.

The previous row: **2026-09-07, `main` @ v5.3.0 — 47/47, 45/45, 15/15**, the run the two
dependency majors (better-sqlite3 13, vitest 5) had been owed since v4.0.0; no regression
surfaced, and it was the first run in which the **self-heal sections measured something**
(A10 and B8 both logged `the shipped prebuild would not load — moved aside to
…/prebuilds/linux-x64.node.unusable`, so `c9c1acb`'s quarantine is exercised in the real
plugin cache AND the real managed install, not just asserted).

## Architecture — where new code goes

_Verbatim from CLAUDE.md lines 157-177 at v6.5.0._

### Where new code goes

The four big files — `mem-cli.mjs` 4156, `install.mjs` 3203, `hook.mjs` 3187, `server.mjs`
2413 (measured 2026-09-05 at `a8d7dd1`, **after** the `36f8c0f` reformat; they were 3300 /
2697 / 2615 / 1982 before it, same code) — are **routers and faces, not a split left
half-finished**.
v2.41 moved four handlers into `cli/` and stopped; the direction that took hold since has
produced **87 modules under `lib/`**: logic two faces share (CLI and MCP, or two hook
events) gets extracted into a `lib/*-core.mjs`, and the big file keeps only argument
parsing, rendering, and wiring.

- **Shared by two or more faces → `lib/`.** This kills the twin-drift defect class this
  project keeps paying for. Register every new module in BOTH `source-files.mjs` and
  `package.json#files` — a missed registration has shipped a broken tarball three times.
- **Owned by exactly one face → it stays in that face's file.** Moving it buys a file and
  an import, not a guarantee.
- **No standalone split project.** `cli/common.mjs` is a shared render layer `server.mjs`
  also imports, so the directory name is already wrong; a further split spreads that.

Line count is not the trigger — a shared code path is.

## Measurement doctrine — the ten rules, with their evidence

_Verbatim from CLAUDE.md lines 179-257 at v6.5.0._

This repo measures its own retrieval quality, and most of its expensive mistakes have been
*measurement* mistakes, not code mistakes. These ten rules are the distilled result; the
evidence for each is in `docs/measurement/`. **Violating one silently produces a number
that looks measured and is not.**

1. **Stamp every number** with its date AND the tree/corpus it came from. A figure without
   a stamp cannot be superseded by a later reader.
2. **Never diff two runs taken at different times.** Every corpus here grows every session
   — including the session writing the note that quotes it. Run both arms back-to-back, or
   use a `--split` that cuts one walk into two arms.
3. **State the population.** "Which rows" is a required field, not a caveat. Filtered vs
   raw observation counts have shipped wrong drafts at least twice (`liveObsFilterSql`).
4. **A count is a smoke alarm; the name set is the evidence.** Never attribute a delta by
   subtracting two counts — do a same-tree A/B and diff names.
5. **A ruler must be able to say NO.** Every self-check gets driven to failure; a check
   nothing can break is not a check. Mutation-verify.
6. **A ruler must not pollute what it measures.** `searchRelevantMemories` writes
   (`injection_count`) *and* emits a metric row — pass `{ counterfactual: true }`. A
   readonly DB handle shuts only one of the two sinks. This rule was violated in the same
   release that cited it as precedent.
7. **Measure the RELEASE tree, and measure it last** — the tag names that tree, including
   its pre-tag review repairs.
8. **Absolutes from a recency-weighted selector are snapshots, not properties.** A
   named-row list is an instant; re-running quickly does not make it reproducible.
9. **A NEUTRAL from a structurally blind ruler says nothing.** `denoise-ab` drives
   `search-engine.mjs` only — it cannot see the `fyi`, `task_imperative`, `error_recall` or
   Key Context faces. Check what a ruler imports before trusting its Δ=0.
10. **Correct the premise before quoting it.** Several ledger entries were filed against
    the wrong culprit or with the ratio inverted; the fix was measuring, not arguing.

## Baselines — caliber breaks, knip contract, coverage scope

_Verbatim from CLAUDE.md lines 300-413 at v6.5.0._

**`scripts/audit-metrics.mjs` module counts changed CALIBER in the R5 batch — do not diff
across it.** `cycles()` and `untestedModules()` used to count `*.config.mjs` as source
modules while `depsMd()` did not, so `--md` printed 163 and `--deps` printed 161 for what
reads as one set, and `eslint.config.mjs` was listed as a source module with no test. All
four reporters now share one predicate (`isGraphModule`), and `--self-check` fails if they
ever disagree again. Modules **163 → 161**, untested **24 / 163 → 23 / 161**. Edges are
unchanged (481 static + 48 lazy, 0 cycles) — both config files have zero local imports, so
only the node count moved.

Re-stamped at `cc4fc5e` (2026-09-06, post-R10): **148 modules, 444 static + 44 lazy edges,
0 cycles**, 171 functions over 50 lines of 1855, duplicate rate 5.15% any / 2.26%
cross-file. `npm run audit:selfcheck` exits 0, so all four reporters still agree. Do not
read 161 → 148 as deletion — the two readings come from different rounds and this row's own
lesson is that the population moved underneath the number.

**`--self-check` also stopped leaking** (R10 P2-18): its `fail()` called `process.exit(1)`,
which skips the `finally` that removes its probe directory, so every failing self-check left
an `audit-metrics-selfcheck-` directory in `/tmp`. It throws now, and the exit is deferred
past the `finally` — moving the exit into the `catch` skips it just the same, which a
forced-failure probe caught.

**The 2026-09-05 whole-tree reformat (`36f8c0f`) changed the CALIBER of four
line-denominated metrics. Do not diff any of them across it** — prettier split one-line
statements, so the denominators grew while no code was added or removed:

| Metric | before `36f8c0f` | at `a8d7dd1` | why it is not a regression |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source lines | 52,356 | **61,311** | same 167 files |
| Functions > 50 lines | 140 | **179** | same ~2,045 functions; the threshold is in LINES |
| Duplicate rate any / cross-file | 1.88% / 0.29% | **5.15% / 2.35%** | uniform formatting makes far more 6-line windows compare equal |
| Coverage **lines** | 87.67% | **85.44%** | statements (84.34) and functions (89.26) did not move — only the line denominator did |

Re-stamp from `a8d7dd1`, never from an earlier figure.

**vitest 5.0.0 (2026-09-06) is a second caliber break, on coverage only. Do not diff coverage
across it.** Same-tree back-to-back A/B, whole suite both arms: pass/fail set byte-identical
(357 files / 5910 passed + 1 skipped), branches and functions columns unmoved on every row,
and exactly three files plus the root aggregate changed — `registry.mjs` 86.78 → **81.60**
stmts / 89.50 → **85.18** lines with an **identical uncovered-line list**, `env-number.mjs`
100 → **95.83** stmts with lines still 100 and the same uncovered line 102, and
`timeline-core.mjs` 97.26 → **95.89** stmts whose uncovered list **grew**, 185 → 139,185.
Same code, same uncovered lines, different denominator. Aggregate 84.30 / 85.40 →
**84.18 / 85.30**; the gate's `lines: 83` floor is 2.3 points below the new reading.

**Knip measurement contract** (full version + name-set history in
`docs/measurement/baselines.md`):

1. **Command + context are part of the number.** Measure from the **primary working tree**.
   A `git worktree --detach` checkout once read ~15 LOWER on the same commit — reproduced
   then, **cause still not established**. Never mix contexts. A fresh **CI** clone lands on
   the working-tree side (n=2, identical name sets both rounds).
   **2026-09-06: the discriminating arm ran and did NOT reproduce the offset, but it does
   not settle the cause — do not read it as a retirement.** A `git worktree --detach` at
   `61a6f66` with its **OWN `npm ci`** (a real directory, not a symlink — verified) read
   **45** with a name set byte-identical to the primary tree's reading of the same commit
   (sets diffed, not counts, one fixed commit in both arms). With R9's symlinked-`node_modules`
   arm (48 = 48) that is two worktree arms and no offset, so the offset is **not** a property
   of the checkout alone. Two reasons that is still not a cause:
   (a) **The historical gap's population is largely gone.** `docs/measurement/baselines.md`
   enumerated it as `utils.mjs:12-15`'s backward-compat re-exports **plus their `nlp.mjs` /
   `registry-retriever.mjs` sources** — and `registry-retriever.mjs` was deleted with the
   skill registry in v5.0.0. A non-reproduction against a different population is weak
   evidence about the mechanism.
   (b) **An earlier draft of this rule named the wrong mechanism, in the wrong direction.**
   It said a partial `node_modules` makes imports unresolvable "which reads as unused" —
   that would push the count **UP**, and the observed offset was **DOWN** (31 worktree vs 46
   primary at `2ebc159`). Doctrine rule 10. The mechanisms that could lower a count are the
   documented ones: knip dropping whole modules from the report (the `new URL(...)` blind
   spot), gitignore evaluation, and `knip.json` listing `tests/**/*.test.mjs` as `entry`
   while `project` excludes `tests/**`.
   **Practical rule, unchanged: measure from the primary tree, and never mix a reading from
   another context into the baseline.** What the new arm buys is that a worktree reading is
   no longer presumed 15 low — it is worth diffing name sets against the primary tree rather
   than discarding.
2. **Never attribute a round's delta by subtracting two counts** (doctrine rule 4).
3. **A count is a smoke alarm; the name set is the evidence.**
4. **In `--reporter json`, every issue object carries a `files` key that is ALWAYS an
   array, empty or not** — `.filter(i => i.files)` counts every issue and reads as 18
   unused files against a text report showing none. Count elements, cross-check the text
   reporter.

Two categories of baseline entry: **(a) intentional** — v2.21 `utils.mjs` backward-compat
re-exports + test-only exports; do NOT remove without audit. **(b) NOT intentional** — the
v3 dispatch/invocation CRUD was confirmed dead and deleted in 2026-06; if invocation-stats
names reappear they are rot from a reverted feature. Treat the baseline as a floor; flag
NEW unused exports as PR review signal.

**Coverage `include` is a DENYLIST since 2026-09-07 — everything shipped is measured, and
staying out costs a named `exclude` entry.** It reads `lib/**/*.mjs`, `cli/**/*.mjs`,
`server/**/*.mjs`, `*.mjs`; `*.mjs` is root-only because vitest 5 matches the RELATIVE
path. Deliberately **outside**: `install.mjs`, `server.mjs`, `hook.mjs`, `cli.mjs`,
`*.config.mjs`, `benchmark/**`, `scripts/**`, `experiment/**` — the four entry files are
exercised through subprocess E2E, which v8 coverage of the parent process cannot observe.
**Quote the v8 text reporter, not `coverage/clover.xml`** (different caliber, will not
reconcile).

**The sentence this replaces was wrong in the way doctrine rule 3 exists to prevent**: it
said "`lib/**` plus hand-picked root modules" and named three exclusions, while the
allowlist actually left **24 shipped modules — 10,137 lines against 30,305 — outside with
no stated reason**, so 85.83% described 62.5% of the shipped tree. Among the invisible:
`search-engine.mjs`, `scoring-sql.mjs`, `rerank.mjs`, `deep-search.mjs` — the retrieval
core this whole doctrine is about — plus all of `cli/**` (including `cli/common.mjs`, the
shared render layer `server.mjs` imports) and `server/fts-check.mjs`. This was the THIRD
round to find code hiding in that allowlist (P2-2 2026-08-22, P1-15 2026-09-02), and the
first to remove the mechanism rather than the instance.

`tests/coverage-scope.test.mjs` pins the scope, and **its matcher model is
version-coupled — read `BaseCoverageProvider.isIncluded`, do not remember it.** It
modelled vitest **4** (absolute path, `{ contains: true }`) for the whole of vitest 5 and
nothing went red, because the old simple `include` made both semantics agree. It now
models v5 (relative path, no `contains`) behind a tripwire that fails on the next major.
Under the stale model an `exclude` entry was a SUBSTRING test, so `'cli.mjs'` also
excluded `mem-cli.mjs` and `adopt-cli.mjs`.

## Invariants that bite — full text, all 38

_Verbatim from CLAUDE.md lines 415-1189 at v6.5.0._

Full evidence for the first three in `docs/measurement/findings.md`.

- **`PostToolUse` does NOT fire for a tool call the host marks as failed.** Those go to
  `PostToolUseFailure` (registered since v3.79.0, D#170), where the failure text is in
  `error` — there is no `tool_response` — and `additionalContext` is the injection channel.
  Before that, `error_recall` was blind to every host-flagged failure. **Do not try to fix
  this class by widening `HARD_ERROR_RE`** — every anchor D#151 named measured zero gain
  over 1110 real transcripts. The failure path deliberately does not feed the episode
  buffer, and gates on `lib/tool-refusal.mjs` because **68.9% of host-flagged Bash failures
  are the agent's own guardrails refusing**, not programs failing.
  Off switch: `CLAUDE_MEM_ERROR_RECALL_ON_FAILURE=off`.
- **`Stop` fires once per assistant TURN, and `/clear` ROTATES the host session id.** Both
  were measured 2026-09-07, and the code had modelled both backwards since long before R10.
  Stop deleted the session file on the "Stop = /exit" model, so `getSessionId()` minted a
  fresh mem session on the next event (58 prompts / 16 host sessions → **56** mem sessions
  and 56 `session_summaries` rows, 0 of which carried the LLM-only fields) **and**
  `handleSessionStart`'s mid-restart probe — which reads that same file — never fired, so
  the `/clear` handoff branch was unreachable in production (**0** `clear` rows against 21
  sessions). The rotation half is the discriminator R10 §8 said not to guess at: of 21 real
  transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/`, 12 carry a `<command-name>/clear` record
  and in **12/12** its timestamp precedes its own file's first record by ~0.1s (−0.08…−0.19s)
  — the command is issued in the OLD session and replayed into a NEW file under a NEW id.
  Consequences that outlive the fix: (a) the session file now survives Stop, so **the file's
  presence no longer tells you why a session started** — ask the host's stdin `source`
  (`startup|clear|compact|resume`), which is why SessionStart reads it; (b) under rotation a
  `/clear` handoff is written under the NEW cc id while the prompts it summarises carry the
  OLD one, so `buildAndSaveHandoff` falls back to the unscoped prompt query when the scoped
  one is empty — D#26's scoping is there to stop two live sessions MERGING, and an empty
  scope has nothing to merge with. Revert: `CLAUDE_MEM_LEGACY_STOP_UNLINK=1` (re-breaks the
  clear path by design). **`tests/handoff-simulation.test.mjs` asserts on its own local
  re-implementation of the SessionStart output, not on the hook's** — it is why "Working
  State (from /clear)" had passing tests for a block no user had ever seen.
- **`hooks/hooks.json` and `install.mjs`'s direct `settings.json` entries are two separate
  hook sets and must be changed together** — `tests/audit-silent-20260814.test.mjs` diffs
  them and is verified binding. **That diff does not compare `timeout`**, which is how
  SessionStart ran with 15 s under the plugin shape and 10 s under the settings.json shape
  for several releases (R10 P2-16, now both 15). If you add a field to either set, ask
  whether the guard actually reads it.
- **The SessionStart "### Recent" table is a SELECTION, and it used to be rendered in the
  selector's own order.** `selectWithTokenBudget` is a greedy knapsack over value density; the
  block is headed "Recent (<date>)" with a Time column, so both a human and the model read row
  1 as the newest thing that happened. Observed in a real injection: rows timed 14:34, 07:13,
  11:20, 08:56, 06:02, 13:46, 04:44, 07:27, 04:44, under that heading. Sorting is DISPLAY-only
  — both sites copy before sorting and the "Recent Activity" fallback slices FIRST and sorts
  the slice, so which rows are injected and the token budget are untouched. Tiebroken on id,
  per D#9.
- **An MCP tool's advertised JSON Schema is not its enforced schema, and `.pipe()` is where
  they part.** zod 4's `toJSONSchema({io:'input'})` renders a ZodPipe's INPUT side, so
  `coerceInt.pipe(z.number().int().min(1).max(100))` published the bare safe-integer range —
  ±9007199254740991 — against an enforced 1..100. Measured before the fix: **20 of 36
  constrained fields disagreed**, every one in the direction that invites a rejected call
  (`mem_compress.age_days` advertised unbounded against an enforced ≥30; `mem_delete.ids`, a
  DESTRUCTIVE tool, advertised no array bounds at all against an enforced 1..50). The fix is
  to put the constraint INSIDE the `z.preprocess` — which is what `coerceDeferredTokens` and
  `coerceMixedIdTokens` already did, and why their `minItems`/`maxItems` were always right.
  Same `.pipe()` blind spot the round before found in `required`. `tests/tool-schemas.test.mjs`
  grades the input rendering AGAINST the output one and requires equality; **grading against
  `io:'output'` alone would be vacuous**, because `.pipe()` renders the correct bounds there —
  only the input side ever lied.
- **`claude mcp remove -s project` edits the repository you are standing in.** `install` ran it
  as part of "purge any pre-existing registration", and that file belongs to the user's repo,
  not to this installer: running the installer from a clone of THIS repo emptied the tracked
  root `.mcp.json` — the plugin's own MCP manifest, and a `RELEASE_SIGNED_FILES` entry — with
  no output saying so, and the only thing that noticed was `tests/plugin-manifest.test.mjs`.
  `uninstall` had always removed `-s user` only (verified across all 156 revisions of
  `install.mjs`), so the scope discipline already existed on the other half of the lifecycle.
  Install now warns instead, on BOTH branches — a project-scoped entry shadows the user-scope
  one whichever way the server is provided, so the disclosure is not plugin-conditional even
  though the removal was.
- **Search's reported `total` is NOT the number of rows you can page to, and since D#5 the
  surfaces say so.** `computePerSourceWindow` is offset-independent by design (D#30: an
  offset-scaled pool re-ranks its own prefix under RRF, so pages overlapped and gapped on a
  vector-populated DB) — that bound is correct and stays. `countSearchTotal` meanwhile
  re-derives the FULL match+filter population, so the two numbers answer different
  questions. Measured 2026-09-07 on a 128-row sandbox corpus: last non-empty offset
  **59 / 59 / 89** for limits **10 / 20 / 30**, i.e. at the default `mem_search` limit of 20,
  **60 of 128 rows (46.9%) are unreachable at ANY offset**. `reachabilityNote`
  (`lib/search-core.mjs`) now discloses it on both faces; off switch
  `CLAUDE_MEM_REACH_DISCLOSURE=off`. **The reachable count is `preFinalizeCount`
  (`results.length` pre-slice), never a re-derived `max(limit*3, 60)`** — `perSourceLimit`
  is PER SOURCE, so a cross-source query fuses up to four such pools and the formula would
  understate its reach. Guarded by `tests/search-reachability-note.test.mjs`, including
  that BOTH faces call the shared helper and read `reachable` from the same source; four
  mutations, four kills.
  **D#20 then found that the two numbers are not the same CALIBER, and the note now goes
  SILENT rather than guess** (2026-09-08, R11-A-P2-2, closed). `total` is the SQL
  MATCH+filter population; `reachable` is measured AFTER the JS-side post-filters, which
  `countSearchTotal` models none of. So rows a filter removed landed in `total - reachable`
  and were reported as a pool bound, with a remedy that cannot work: reproduced at 80
  matching rows of which tier keeps 5, reading "80 rows match but only the first 5 are
  pageable … Raise the limit to widen the pool" — those 75 are not behind the pool, and no
  limit reaches them, because they fail the caller's OWN filter. D#5's `reachable === 0`
  guard above was the same reasoning applied to only one case.
  **THREE sites report into one accumulator, and a fix that instruments fewer is not done**:
  `applyTierFilter` at BOTH `tierPosition`s (`early` is the CLI's, `late` the MCP's — two
  call sites, not one) plus the prompts leg's `cjkPrecisionOk` gate on BOTH its return
  paths. `searchPromptsFts` takes an optional `stats` out-param rather than a new return
  shape.
  **The cost is real and is not a bug**: with a tier filter active the D#5 disclosure goes
  quiet even where a genuine pool bound coexists. Silence was chosen over a re-wording
  because the note makes one claim and offers one remedy and a post-filter invalidates
  both. **Do not "improve" this by quoting `total - postFilterDropped`** — drops are only
  counted for rows that reached the pool, so it is a floor on the correction rather than
  the governed population, and it would print a number the rest of the output never shows.
  The deeper fix — making `countSearchTotal` model the post-filters so `total` IS
  post-filter cardinality — is a released-artifact user-visible change to the "Found 10 of
  128" line, i.e. L3, and is deliberately not taken here.
- **A SQL `LIMIT` upstream of a JS-side relevance filter is a REACHABILITY bound, not a
  ranking bound.** It silently makes well-matching rows unpickable, and an importance
  demotion across the pool's `WHERE` becomes an *eviction* rather than a down-rank. This
  shape has been found on five faces. Count such populations with the pool's OWN
  `liveObsFilterSql`, never a bare `WHERE importance = 3`.
- **`ORDER BY created_at_epoch DESC` without an id tiebreaker INVERTS itself on a tie, and the
  ties are common.** Measured 2026-09-07, both arms, because two mechanisms fitted the
  observation and they need different fixes. **Not** SQLite's plan varying: 8 rows forced onto
  one epoch, 200 queries over 20 fresh DBs, exactly **one** returned order. It is that the ties
  themselves differ per run — two inserts reading `Date.now()` each (the
  `tests/test-helpers.mjs:75` shape, and the shape production writes take) land in the **same
  millisecond 272/300 = 90.67%** and straddle 28/300. **That rate belongs to THAT population
  and does not travel**: audit R12 partition B measured the UPS and pre-tool-recall faces
  (45 obs trigger keys + 542 events keys + three projects' `searchRecent`) at **0.00%**
  same-millisecond pairing with zero boundary ties, so the tiebreak question is unreachable
  there — quoting 90.67% at those faces would be borrowing another population's number.
  The damage is in the DIRECTION, which
  neither the audit nor I predicted: **on a tie SQLite returns ASCENDING rowid — oldest first —
  while an untied pool returns newest first**, so the stated "newest first" silently flips
  whenever the clock has not ticked. Two harm classes follow, and they are not the same:
  (1) `ORDER BY … LIMIT n` feeding JS-side work makes pool MEMBERSHIP arbitrary at the boundary
  (reproduced: five eligible rows on one epoch, limit 3, returned the three **oldest**); (2)
  anything treating the first row as privileged picks arbitrary CONTENT — `executeMergeCluster`'s
  keeper reduce fell through to `cluster[0]` on a full tie, and same-episode duplicates ARE a
  full tie, so which duplicate survived depended on a millisecond boundary. Fixed in
  `hook-optimize.mjs` only — **all SEVEN `ORDER BY … created_at_epoch DESC` sites in the file,
  and the first pass shipped six.** **Two different counts live here and a draft of this bullet
  conflated them, which pre-ship review caught**: `findReenrichCandidates` holds **five** pools
  (five `db.prepare` blocks — `scopes`, `aliases`, `concepts`, `wide`, `narrow`); the **file**
  holds seven such sites, those five plus `extractUniqueConcepts` and `findMergeCandidates`. So
  "count the `db.prepare` blocks" answers *how many pools*, not *how many sites* — an earlier
  draft handed the reader that method for the seven and it returns five. The count has now been
  wrong twice in the same direction, both times because a `grep` for the one-line
  `created_at_epoch DESC, id DESC` spelling cannot see an `ORDER BY` that leads with a
  multi-line `CASE …` term. Two do: `scopes` (found in the first pass) and **`wide` (missed —
  fixed 2026-09-07)**. `wide` was the costly one to miss: it is the scope the DAILY unattended
  path passes explicitly (`handleLLMOptimize` via auto-maintain, `reenrich` budget 6), so a
  boundary tie decided **which rows reach the LLM on a given run** — not which rows are ever
  reached, because `executeReenrich` stamps `optimized_at` in the same UPDATE as the enrichment
  and a processed row leaves the pool. Permanent starvation needs the pass to keep *skipping*
  the same rows (no LLM slot, or unparseable JSON — both `continue` without stamping), which is
  reachable but conditional. It went unnoticed because the original boundary test drove
  `scope: 'narrow'` only. Plus the keeper reduce, made total on its own because it is exported
  and callers build their own clusters.
  **An EIGHTH ordering in the same file is deliberately NOT fixed, and naming it is what makes
  the completeness claim true**: `findSmartCompressCandidates` (`hook-optimize.mjs:1102`) runs
  `ORDER BY project, created_at_epoch` — ascending, no `id`, no `LIMIT` — so it falls outside
  the seven by construction and outside the 52 below (which excludes this file). It feeds
  `clusterForCompression`, and a tie can move cluster MEMBERSHIP on the path that hides rows.
  **Its excuse expired on 2026-09-07 and the priority went UP, not down.** The excuse was that
  the damage needed the TF-IDF cosine branch, which required a default-off env flag; Phase-2
  deleted that branch, so what remains is a 14-day window whose sub-cluster anchor is
  `sorted[0]` after a STABLE JS sort — which preserves SQL order as the tiebreak. The hazard is
  therefore unconditional now, on the default path. Still left alone under Iron Law #1 because
  no failing case has been built. **Unjudged, not cleared — and no longer gated.**
  **Superseded 2026-09-26 by the N3 census below: it now ends on `id`**, which pins the ascending
  rowid order R11 §5 measured (60/60) rather than changing it.
  **2026-09-25: the two `scripts/pre-tool-recall.js` legs were judged and fixed** (D#36): a built
  same-millisecond tie gave the Read slot to the older row, and both now end on `id DESC`. The live
  tie rate over those legs' own populations (importance >= 2, live, 60-day window; key = project +
  lowercased basename + epoch, file lists exploded) read 0/103 observation rows and 0/2681 event
  rows (read-only, 2026-09-25T17:38Z). Whether D#15's 52 below counted these two was not
  re-derived, so do not subtract them from it.
  **2026-09-26: the `hook-handoff.mjs` reads left over from D#67 were judged.** The two
  `session_summaries` reads behind the `<session-summary>` append (exact `memory_session_id`
  arm and the nearest-in-time fallback) now end on `id DESC`; a built tie attached the OLDER
  summary on both, and each tiebreaker was mutated alone and killed by its own case. The eight
  `session_handoffs` reads (Stage -1 / 0 / 2 and `pickHandoffToInject`, both arms each) are
  **judged and deliberately left untiebroken**: the table has no id column, and its rowid is
  not recency because the writer is an UPSERT that keeps the row's original rowid, so on a
  tie `rowid DESC` picks the older write exactly when the LOWER-rowid row was written last —
  a shape only a rewrite can produce (the v6.13.3 claims and delta reviews; two earlier
  wordings of this sentence, "exactly the rewritten rows" and "whenever a tie involves a
  rewritten row", were both too broad). A real
  tiebreaker needs a column, i.e. a migration. Live tie rate 0 groups over 51 handoff rows and
  0 over 450 summary rows (read-only, 2026-09-26, key = project + `created_at_epoch`).
  **`session_summaries` has the same shape on one path**, which the first draft of this
  paragraph missed (v6.13.3 defect review P3-1): `hook-llm.mjs`'s fast-to-LLM UPDATE rewrites
  `created_at_epoch` and keeps the row's `id`, so there too `id` is insertion order, not write
  order, and a tie between an upgraded row and a later insert picks the older write when the
  upgrade lands after that insert (built by the review, not observed). Only upgraded rows can
  invert (`notes = 'llm'`, 14 of 452), and over the **281** same-project pairs whose lower-id
  row is one of them, `id` order disagrees with `created_at_epoch` order on **0**; the
  handoff table reads **2 of 173** same-project pairs (rowid) because it is rewritten on every
  Stop rather than once. Read-only, 2026-09-26T08:21Z; a snapshot of how often each table is
  rewritten, not a structural guarantee. **Moved, not gone (D#79, same day):** the LLM upgrade
  no longer touches `created_at_epoch`; SessionStart's /clear path now moves an EXISTING row to
  `now` instead of inserting one (`writeClearSummary`), so that write is where `id` and
  `created_at_epoch` order can now disagree, and `id DESC` on this table stays best-effort.
  **2026-09-26, D#75: five more reads in the same family, and one writer.** `hook-context.mjs`'s observation
  pool (LIMIT 200), session pool (LIMIT 10), cross-project fallback (LIMIT 5) and "Last Session"
  read (LIMIT 1), plus `lib/fast-summary.mjs`'s observation titles (LIMIT 5), now end on
  `id DESC`; a built tie picked the OLDEST rows on each. Both pools feed a stable sort, so a
  tie decides injected rows even below the LIMIT whenever the 2000-token budget binds, and for
  observations also through the per-type cap of 3 (the new session case tests AT the
  LIMIT; the v6.13.4 claims review measured the below-LIMIT budget case, [1,2,3] → [3,4,5]).
  `hook-llm.mjs`'s `existingFast` had no ORDER BY and upgraded the LOWEST-id fast row of a
  session (by index order). A first draft (`43571e3`) switched it to the highest id, to keep
  `id` order equal to write order, and the v6.13.4 defect review found that to be a
  regression: with two fast rows (Stop plus the unguarded SessionStart /clear-or-/compact path — 74
  sessions had exactly two `notes = 'fast'` rows at 08:38Z, 75 at 08:50Z) the lower id is the
  Stop row, whose structural Done / Not done extract is what the UPDATE's COALESCE floor keeps
  when Haiku returns a field empty. Of the 75 live pairs 5 differ; in 4 the higher id has less
  of every compared column, and in 342/348 it has an 11-char request the lower lacks while the
  lower has 210 chars of completed. None of the 75 sessions has an observation, so none can
  reach the upgrade today (09:17Z): the pairs picture what the two writers produce, not a
  firing rate. A Stop row whose tail carries Failed / Uncertain lines is not stored as
  `notes = 'fast'` at all, and two further shapes lose the structural lines whatever the
  order — D#80 (delta review P3-2..P3-4). It then said `ORDER BY id ASC`, the old behaviour spelled out;
  that was replaced the same day by one summary row per session (next bullet), which retires
  the question of which fast row to upgrade. The draft's premise was also wrong: upgrading
  is not "the one shape" that breaks id order — a late upgrade of the PREVIOUS session's row
  re-stamps it above the next session's newer row with no tie at all (same review, P3-1;
  D#79). So on session_summaries `id DESC` resolves an insert/insert tie correctly and is
  best-effort beyond that. Each of the five hook-context / fast-summary tiebreakers, reverted
  alone, is killed by its own case only.
  Live tie groups 0 over 162 observations and 452 summaries (read-only, 2026-09-26T08:38Z).
  Judged and left: the two `session_handoffs` reads at `hook-context.mjs` "Working State"
  (same reason as above; the session-scoped arm is also PK-unique, one row at most). Not
  judged here: the `deferred_work` ordering (`priority DESC, created_at_epoch ASC`, whose open
  question is whether the ROW_NUMBER ordinal and the display order agree on a tie).
  Judged later the same day: `hook-llm.mjs`'s `linkRelatedObservations` scan (`ORDER BY
  created_at_epoch DESC LIMIT 50`, upstream of a JS file-overlap filter whose first 5
  candidates get linked) now ends on `id DESC` — a built tie of 7 rows linked ids 1..5, the
  OLDEST, and links 7..3 after; the new case is red with the tiebreaker reverted. `hook.mjs`'s
  `buildFallbackFastSummary` (`sdk_sessions … ORDER BY completed_at_epoch DESC LIMIT 1`) is
  judged and LEFT: 0 same-project `completed_at_epoch` ties in `sdk_sessions` (read-only,
  09:40Z), its rows are created only by `INSERT OR IGNORE` so `id` is creation order (the
  ordered column itself is set by an UPDATE at Stop), and the
  path runs only for a startup within 2 minutes of an /exit whose session has no summary yet.
  *(Superseded by the N3 census at the end of this bullet.)* **The other 52 sites in other files are NOT cleared, just unjudged** (D#15 — 52 is a re-count
  by name on 2026-09-07, excluding `CREATE INDEX` definitions and comments; the earlier "~42"
  was an undercount). Most are display order, where an arbitrary tie is cosmetic, and **the tie
  itself is not currently firing on this corpus**: a read-only probe of the real DB found
  **0 tie-groups across all four relevant tables, under TWO groupings** — the pool's own key
  plus `created_at_epoch`, and the strictly looser `created_at_epoch` alone, which is the
  actual tie condition for an untiebroken `ORDER BY created_at_epoch DESC`. Row counts at the
  second probe: observations 25, session_handoffs 3, session_summaries 133, events 771. **The
  first stamp of this bullet said 21 / 3 / 128 / 717 and was stale within the same day** —
  this session's own writes moved three of the four, which is doctrine rule 2 happening to the
  rule that states it. The counts are a snapshot; the 0 is the finding.
  Read that as "has not happened here yet", not "cannot": the 272/300 same-millisecond rate D#9
  measured is the shape of a tight insert LOOP (fixtures, batch writes), and purge/compress
  removes rows, so history is not fully represented. **The 52 is also a count without a
  recorded name set** — reproducible under the caliber stated here (`.mjs`/`.js` outside
  `tests/` and `benchmark/`, `DESC` orderings only, comments and `CREATE INDEX` excluded; the
  same sweep including ASC reads 65), but doctrine rule 4 wants the names, and nobody can
  supersede a count they cannot diff. **R11 §5 records the name set for three partitions** —
  the retrieval core, the citation chain and the LLM write paths — judged one by one:
  **19 harmful, 15 clean**. Four of the harmful are now total (`search-engine.mjs`
  `findFtsAnchor` and the no-query recent listing; `lib/search-core.mjs` type-list fallback
  and prompts CJK LIKE fallback); the rest are named and left, most because they move
  candidate-pool membership and therefore owe a denoise-ab first. **Do not subtract 19/15
  from the 52** — different caliber: R11 counted ASC orderings and `hook-optimize.mjs`, both
  of which the 52 excludes by construction. `findFtsAnchor` is the one worth remembering:
  with `LIMIT 1` the tie decided the timeline ANCHOR, so the whole navigation window moved,
  which is the CONTENT harm class rather than the pool-boundary one. Re-probe with
  `SELECT project||'/'||type k, created_at_epoch e, COUNT(*) c FROM session_handoffs GROUP BY k, e
  HAVING c > 1` before spending a round on the remaining sites. Match `hook-memory.mjs:683`'s
  spelling (`importance DESC, created_at_epoch DESC, id DESC`) — it is the one face that already
  got this right.
  **2026-09-26, N3 (session-history analysis r2 §4.3): the census closes the population, and
  the "52 unjudged" above is superseded.** Caliber, which differs from the 52's: the `.mjs`/`.js`
  entries of `package.json#files` (so `scripts/*.js` in, `benchmark/` and `tests/` out), SQL
  read from the AST (literals, templates, `+` chains; SQL `--` comments stripped), ASC and DESC,
  every clause whose terms name `created_at` / `created_at_epoch`, including window
  `OVER (ORDER BY …)`; no shipped `.sh`/`.md`/`.json` carries one. `CREATE INDEX` excluded.
  Result on `fa66e5d` (pre-fix): **76 clauses, 38 already on `id`, 27 fixed, 11 left**.

  | Verdict | Clauses | Sites |
  |---|---|---|
  | Already on `id` | 38 | D#9 / R11 / D#36 / D#67 / D#75 sites (hook-handoff 6, hook-context 5, hook-optimize 7, hook-llm 5, search-core 5, fast-summary 3, pre-tool-recall 2, one each in search-engine, hook-memory, recall-core, save-observation, user-prompt-search) |

  Six DESC faces got built-tie cases (`tests/created-at-tiebreak-census.test.mjs`), all six red
  before (`[1,2,3]` for `[5,4,3]`). `tests/order-by-created-at-guard.test.mjs` now holds the
  population: a clause naming created_at must end on `id`/`rowid` of the same alias, same
  direction for a bare column, or match an allowlist entry keyed on file + table + clause with
  an exact count; a case asserts `session_handoffs` still has no id column, so the excuse
  expires with its premise. Mutation-verified with the REAL reverts (`git show` of 8876cc4^,
  43571e3^ on two files, d06dc32^, bbf1490^ — each red naming exactly the sites its commit
  fixed) plus eight live-file mutants. Live tie groups, read-only on a DB copy
  2026-09-26T16:35Z, keyed project + `created_at_epoch`: observations 0/172 rows, events
  **1**/4112 (the first live tie this bullet has recorded), session_summaries 0/327,
  deferred_work 0/96, session_handoffs 0/71; user_prompts 0/789 on the epoch alone.
  **Not in the census**: orderings on other time columns (`completed_at_epoch`,
  `started_at_epoch`, `resolved_at`) and score-led orders whose expression folds in a decay of
  `created_at_epoch` (error-recall's `bm25 × decay`, R10 B3).
  **A tie can also hide a row, not just misorder it** (found by this census, fixed in `d4e6d18`):
  `fetchTimelineWindow`'s legs compared the epoch strictly, so a row sharing the ANCHOR's
  millisecond fell out of both the before and the after leg. Both now compare
  `(created_at_epoch, id)`; built ties with the anchor first / middle / last were red before.
- **2026-09-26, D#79 / D#80: one summary row per session.** Every `session_summaries` writer
  assumed one Stop per mem session. Stop always fired per assistant turn; since R10-P1-1 the
  mem session also survives it, so every writer runs many times against a session that
  already has a row. Three consequences, measured read-only at 09:34Z: (1) duplicate rows,
  **458 for 312 sessions** — one session 37 rows in 65 minutes (37 distinct `completed`),
  another 15. By writer (re-measured on the 11:13Z pre-dedup backup, 465 / 318): of 147
  surplus rows **87 came from SessionStart's /clear-or-/compact path** inserting beside
  Stop's row (84 still `fast`, 3 later upgraded by the model) and **60 from the LLM worker**,
  spawned by every Stop, which upgraded the `notes = 'fast'` row once and then INSERTed on
  every later turn of a session with observations. Session search for the 37-row session's
  own words returned it for **10 of 10** hits ("test suites") and **9 of 10** ("shell
  scripts"), and `stats` counted rows as sessions. (2) Stop's fast baseline was guarded on "no
  row yet", so its Done / Not done came from the FIRST turn only: over 7 days of this
  machine's transcripts (09:40Z, 107 sessions with a prompt), **20 of the 31** sessions that
  wrote §10 markers had a first-turn extract that differs from their last report; at least
  14 of those 20 had no marker on turn 1 at all (a reviewer's later re-count on a grown set
  read 94 / 35 / 28 / 22 — same direction). (3) The same guard froze the observation-title
  fallback of a session that never writes markers at its first turn.
  Now every writer lands on the session's newest row (`newestSummaryId`) and inserts only
  when there is none (`writeStopSummary`, `writeClearSummary`, `mergeModelSummary` in
  `lib/fast-summary.mjs`, each a read-modify-write in one IMMEDIATE transaction), and **the
  head of `notes` records, per FIELD, where Done and Not done came from** —
  `done<report|model|titles> left<report|other>`, then the latest report's Failed / Uncertain
  lines — with precedence report > model > titles for Done and report > other for Not done.
  Stop refreshes Done from a report's Done, else a `titles` Done from the current titles, and
  Not done from any report ('' = nothing left); /clear fills gaps, replaces a `titles` Done,
  never touches a `report` Not done and moves the row to `now`; the model fills everything
  except a `report` Done / Not done, floors an empty field on the row itself and then on the
  session's older rows newest first, and **does not move the timestamp** (D#79); its INSERT,
  for a session with no row, is dated at the session's last prompt, not at the worker's
  finish. Rows from older versions map to titles (`fast`, bare Failed / Uncertain text) or
  model (`llm`, '', NULL), never to report, so a pre-upgrade report Done stored under either
  titles value can be replaced by titles once (the delta review's P3-2, accepted), and an
  EMPTY Done takes the titles whatever its tag (third review P3-1: a model-created row with
  no Done, or a legacy '' row, otherwise blocked them). Three review rounds shaped this: the first cut let
  /clear keep a first-turn title fallback as if it were a report and let the model overwrite a
  fresh report (defect review P2-1..P2-3); the repair's single per-row report tag then read a
  Not-done-only or Failed-only tail as a full report and froze stale titles as its Done
  (delta review P2-1, P2-2) — hence one tag per field. The third review (on `d4b3d73`) found
  0 P1 / 0 P2; its P3s were repaired in v6.13.5 except P3-6, reasoned only and older than this
  work: two workers of consecutive turns can land out of order, so an older model reply can
  overwrite a newer one's model fields until the next worker (no report field is affected).
  P3-6 was repaired after the release — see the P3-6 entry below.
  D#79's precondition — an upgraded row of session A dated after the first row of a
  same-project session that STARTED after A — held for **0 of 193** such pairs (3 within 10
  minutes): a built failure, not an observed one. D#80's shapes could not reach the upgrade
  in any two-row session (none has an observation); 3 sessions with 3+ rows did hold two
  `llm` rows, with no content loss seen. Stop now calls the summary writer AFTER citation
  tracking: run before it, the per-turn tail read parsed the parent transcript a second time
  in every session with subagents (the memo holds one file; 126 of 191 main transcripts have
  a subagents folder, claims review) — an e2e case counts the parent reads (1).
  `stats` (CLI + MCP), `status` and `doctor` now count DISTINCT `memory_session_id` for "N
  sessions". Evidence, on the per-field version: 40 single-site mutations (each Stop / /clear
  / model precedence rule, each provenance tag written, the legacy mappings, the floor and its
  order both ways, the target row, the INSERT stamp, no re-stamp, scrubbing, the Stop call
  order and its Failed lines, tie order, the four counts) are each killed by a case in
  `tests/{fast-summary,hook-llm,e2e,stats-core,install-session-count}.test.mjs`; the first
  run left 4 alive (a report arriving on a later turn left untagged on either field, Failed
  lines unscrubbed — the scrub case's notes cut fell inside the secret — and Stop dropping
  those lines), each now killed by a case added for it. On the final tree (after the third review's
  repairs) the set is 43 arms, all killed. The legacy duplicates were then removed from the maintainer's DB by a one-off
  script (11:13Z, user-authorised, backup kept): 465 → 318 rows, 147 deleted, 31 empty fields
  of kept rows filled from deleted ones; Last Session identical before/after in 20 of 20
  projects (the comparer reported 1 of 20 when one project's newest row was deleted). Other
  installs keep theirs. NOT done: the LLM worker still calls the model once per turn for a
  session with observations — a much smaller population than it reads (next entry).
- **2026-09-26, P3-6: a model reply from a superseded Stop no longer lands.** Measured first,
  read-only, 7 days of this machine's main transcripts (a turn counted only when it holds an
  assistant message; its end is the last one): 913 gaps between consecutive turn ends in 95
  sessions — **27 under 10 s, 46 under 20 s** (27 of those 46 open with a
  `<task-notification>`, so they carry no new user prompt), p25 110 s, p50 373 s; a session's
  LAST gap was under 20 s in **4 of 86**. One summary call via OpenRouter took 4545 / 4885 /
  4903 ms (3 calls, one sitting), via the `claude -p` fallback 10057 / 10250 / 9875 ms, before
  the worker's wait for its episode flush. So overlap is
  real but rare, and the ordering key cannot be the prompt number: task-notification turns
  tie on it. The key is the Stop itself. `sdk_sessions.completed_at_epoch` turned out to be
  **frozen at the FIRST turn** — Stop's UPDATE was guarded on `status = 'active'`, which only
  the first Stop matches (one live session: `completed_at` 10:30, last prompt 12:31); its one
  reader, `buildFallbackFastSummary`, is nearly unreachable now that every Stop writes a row.
  Now every Stop records its epoch there (`status IN ('active', 'completed')`) and hands the
  SAME value to the worker as argv[5]; `summarySuperseded` (`lib/fast-summary.mjs`) is checked
  before the model call (the later Stop's worker reads the newer window, so the call is saved)
  and again inside `mergeModelSummary`'s transaction (the later Stop can land during the round
  trip). A spawn without an epoch — /clear, a pre-upgrade worker — always writes. The trade:
  if the later worker then writes nothing, the row keeps the model fields of an earlier turn,
  the same staleness P3-6 produced. The later worker writes nothing when its model reply is
  empty, when it gets no LLM slot, or when it finds no observation — the newer window is not a
  strict superset, since the episode upgrade-delete can remove what the earlier worker read
  (pre-ship defect review P3-1). Unmeasured; the metric below pairs the two by session. Evidence: 8 single-site mutations (the UPDATE guard, the
  spawn argument, the UPDATE's epoch read from a fresh clock, `>` → `>=`, the `<= 0` guard, each
  of the two checks, the merge call's argument) are each killed by a case in
  `tests/{fast-summary,hook-llm,e2e}.test.mjs` (the one in `bg-spawn-skip-flag-invariant` was the
  source scan, since removed). The spawn wire was
  first held by a source scan, on the stated reason that the spawn is off in every e2e case;
  false — several e2e Stop cases spawn the real worker against `scripts/mock-claude.mjs` (claims
  review P2-1). It is now behavioural: an e2e Stop spawns the real worker on a session with no
  observation, and its metric row's `stopEpoch` must equal the stored `completed_at_epoch`
  (killed by a spawn without the argument, and by a fresh clock read at either end).
  **Stop's 5 s timeout** (Uncertain in the v6.13.5 report): the week's 4 largest transcripts
  by main plus subagent bytes (to 27.8 MB, of which 3.5 MB main and 18 subagent files; one with
  68 subagent files; the largest main file alone, 13.2 MB, is among them) timed 164–251 ms for a whole Stop
  through `scripts/hook-launcher.mjs`, sandboxed on a backup copy of the DB, summary spawn off;
  `collectSubagentSurface` read 18 and 68 files in 97 and 59 ms, so the subagent arm ran.
  **Per-turn model calls — the first reading here was of the wrong population.** It said
  "1008 turns in 95 sessions, so at one call per turn ≈ 91% of calls are overwritten", and
  was filed as D#92. But the worker calls the model only when the session has an
  observation, and on the DB (read-only, 7 days, 15:03Z) **4 of 157 hook sessions** hold one,
  with **6 prompts** between them (a first count read "9 of 162" by including 5 `manual-*`
  mem_save pseudo-sessions, which no worker runs for). **7 finished sessions** carry a
  model-written summary by `parseSummaryNotes` (4 `notes = 'llm'`, 3 legacy `''` — a first
  count of 4 missed the latter), so rows were written and the observations deleted after. The
  live session's own row is an 8th at 15:22Z (`donemodel leftreport`); its tag is rewritten
  every turn, so a count that includes it is a snapshot (delta review P2-1). The cause: `saveEpisodeImmediate` pre-saves an observation, `persistHaikuSummary`
  (`hook-llm.mjs:452`) deletes it when Haiku classes it as an event type, and the worker
  waits for that flush before its `SELECT … FROM observations WHERE memory_session_id = ?` —
  auto-captured work lives in `events` now (observation ids 256–281 that day: 19 of 26
  gone). A sandboxed run of the real worker on the previous session read `no-obs` for that
  reason. So the per-turn cost is small, and the larger gap is that the model summary mostly
  never runs; Last Session rests on Stop's report extract. D#92 was dropped for D#95 (via two
  re-filings that corrected counts): feed events — whose summarizer
  `docs/audits/20260925-200912-session-history-analysis.md:212` labelled 2/30 accurate (D#69)
  — or retire the model summary, an LLM-visible change. To read the real rates, each worker
  exit writes a `summary_worker` metric row under `CLAUDE_MEM_METRICS=1`: `no-db`, `no-obs`,
  `slot-timeout`, `superseded-before-call`, `no-content`, `superseded-at-write`, `written`,
  `error`, with `session`, `stopEpoch` and the model call's `llmMs`. As first shipped
  (`91e45ba`) the row had neither session nor epoch value, so this paragraph's claim that it
  measures the P3-6 trade was false (claims review P1-1). With both, the trade is a
  `superseded-*` row of a session with no `written` row at a LATER `stopEpoch` — pair by
  `stopEpoch`, not file order: the successor usually writes before the superseded worker's
  `superseded-at-write` row lands. A worker killed by SIGTERM / SIGINT (the hook's signal
  handler, `hook.mjs:261`), including mid-call, writes no row (delta review P3-4, not fixed).
  **`buildFallbackFastSummary` now checks "has no summary" in its WHERE** (pre-ship defect
  review P3-4): it selected the most recent completed session and checked for a summary after
  `LIMIT 1`, so once every Stop records itself a parallel live session with a summary took the
  slot from the session that exited — an e2e case with both shapes is red on the old SQL.
- **`COALESCE(compressed_into,0)=0` alone is NOT the liveness predicate** — `liveObsFilterSql`
  also requires `superseded_at IS NULL`. **Which sites need the full one is settled; do not
  re-derive it.** Carrying it: the two `COMPRESSED_PENDING_PURGE` writers
  (`decayAndMarkIdle`'s mark-idle arm, `search-scoring.runIdleCleanup`) and
  `mergeDuplicates`' keeper write — because `purgeStale` hard-deletes that sentinel, and
  deleting a retired row destroys the `superseded_by` that the Stop citation loop follows to
  credit a `#NN` to its successor (27 of 31 superseded rows carry one). Deliberately NOT
  carrying it, each for its OWN stated reason:
  - `decayAndMarkIdle`'s **decay arm**, `boostAccessed`, `demotePinned` — move only
    `importance`, inert on a row every read path already hides. (`lib/maintain-core.mjs:436-441`
    says "**the first three**" for exactly this reason; a draft of this bullet flattened that
    into all four and handed `cleanupBroken` an inertness claim that is false.)
  - `markAutoCompressible` — writes `-1`, which both `purgeStale` (`-2`) and
    `recoverOrphanedChildren` (`> 0`) skip, so it cannot delete or resurface anything.
  - **`cleanupBroken` is the one HARD-DELETE site in this set**, and since 2026-09-07 it is
    the one site carrying a NARROWER guard rather than none: `AND superseded_by IS NULL`.
    **This bullet used to say "left bare" — that is no longer true, and D#4 is closed.** It
    was the only place the harm above was reachable at all (deleting a supersede tombstone
    takes `superseded_by` with it), and the only exemption resting on a **likelihood**
    judgement rather than an inertness proof: its rows have no title, narrative or lesson,
    so they are absent from every injection surface, so an id never injected is not one a
    `#NN` cites. Narrow but not impossible — a hand-typed `#NN`, or a numeric
    `save --supersedes` chain later blanked by a degenerate cluster-merge — so it was fixed
    rather than re-argued. **Not the full `liveObsFilterSql`, deliberately**: a retired row
    whose `superseded_by` is null hands `redirectSupersededIds` nothing (it falls through to
    `out.add(id)`, the same answer a missing row gives), so it stays reclaimable; filtering
    on `superseded_at` would strand every empty retired row here forever. Guarded by two
    cases in `tests/superseded-write-guards.test.mjs`, the first verified RED against the
    real pre-fix predicate.
  - `maintenanceStats` — puts `superseded_at IS NULL` inside the **stale** CASE only, so each
    forecast matches the op it predicts rather than one outer predicate that would be wrong
    for `boostable` and `pinned`.
  - `hardDeleteCandidateCount`'s cleanup arm — `cleanupBroken`'s predicate **minus** its
    `lesson_learned` guard, so it deliberately OVER-counts by every lesson-bearing
    empty-content row (`:635-637`: over-counting costs one extra bounded backup). Do not call
    it a mirror; it is directionally-safe on purpose.
  - `stats-core.computeStatsFeed` — one predicate on both halves of a ratio, with superseded
    rows reported on their own line.
  Judged point by point 2026-09-06 across all 11 shipped sites (R8 §6-a, carried as open in
  R10 §7) — **zero code changes warranted at the time**, but read each reason as written:
  they are not the same reason. **The one that was a probability argument is now a guard**
  (`cleanupBroken`, 2026-09-07, D#4 closed); the other ten still stand on the reasons given
  above, and re-deriving them is what that judgement round already paid for.
- **The cross-hook injected-ids marker is a union across TABLES**, so ids need namespacing
  (`injectedIdKey` in `lib/injected-ids.mjs`: `P` prompts, `D` deferred, `E` events,
  observations bare). 91.6% of observation ids also exist as an event id.
- **`Stop` fires once per assistant TURN and rescans the WHOLE transcript, so every Stop-side
  writer needs a per-session idempotency key — and `access_count` values written before
  v5.6.0 are an upper bound, not a count.** Four of the five writers had one
  (`applyCitationDecay` has two: `last_cited_session_id` for promote, `last_decided_session_id`
  for uncited; `recordCitationSurfaces` and `recordCitationFunnel` are idempotent by
  construction). `bumpCitationAccess` had none, and its only multi-call test asserted the
  accumulation as if it were the contract. Measured over 51 real transcripts replayed at true
  turn boundaries: **338 credits across 43 distinct (session, id) pairs = 7.86×**, worst
  single session 18.75×. It feeds `boostAccessed` (`access_count > 3` → `importance + 1`,
  unattended daily) and suppresses `noisePenaltyClause`, whose predicate reads
  `injection_count > access_count * 3`. Fixed by `observations.last_access_session_id` (v48,
  the table's THIRD per-row session key) — deliberately separate from the decay pair, because
  decay resolves a mainOnly set behind `hasMainThreadAssistantText` while this channel
  resolves the whole transcript including sidechains, so one shared key would let either
  channel silence the other. **Existing rows are NOT back-corrected** (the true count is not
  recoverable), and D#206's "at most 3 rows could have crossed the threshold on citations" is
  retracted — it was computed on the premise this fixes, and no replacement bound is measured.
  **Scope the guarantee**: the column holds the LAST crediting session, not a set, so two
  same-project sessions interleaving their turns flip the stamp between them and the key
  degrades toward per-turn counting for that pair — the same bound `last_cited_session_id`
  and `lib/edge-attribution.mjs` already accept. Exact for one session at a time.
- **The cite-recall nudge's `lowStreak` counts SESSIONS, and the saturated knob is the
  THRESHOLD, not the denominator.** The writer sat in `trackCitationsAtStop` and incremented
  per fire, so with ~6 turns per session the silence-after-3 default was reached inside the
  first session: this machine read `lowStreak = 58` for a project with 26 transcripts on
  disk, and 2 of 3 projects had the cite-`#NN` nudge permanently silenced. Fixed via
  `nextCiteStreakState` (payloads with no `lastStreakSession` are pre-fix and discarded once,
  so no file surgery). **RETRACTED 2026-09-09, and the retraction is the point.** This entry
  said the denominator swap "was measured and NOT taken" because "real cite-recall never
  exceeds 0.5 here (min 0, p25 0, median 0.375, p75 0.5, max 0.5) while the threshold
  defaults to 0.6 — a threshold no session can satisfy". Re-measured over all 69 transcripts
  on this machine: the maximum is **0.833** on both denominators (1.000 on the hook-injected
  side if you take the whole 69 rather than the volume-qualifying subset — state which
  population, the two differ), so the threshold IS satisfiable and the gate fires on 46/48 =
  96% wide and 12/14 = 86% narrow, not 100%. The corpus grew 51 → 69 between the readings:
  doctrine rule 2, inside the entry that states it. **What survives is the defect, in a
  different shape**: a gate that is 96% true carries almost no information, and
  `nextCiteLowStreak` resets only when the gate does NOT fire, so the streak still reaches
  the silence-after-3 default and the surface still dies. v6.6.0 takes the swap that this
  entry declined AND moves the threshold to 0.4 — see the CHANGELOG entry for the
  distribution both decisions were read off. This paragraph is the fourth recurrence of
  "a retraction must sweep all copies": the earlier three missed on wording, on entity and
  on scope; this one was missed on FILE — the round corrected CLAUDE.md and the deferred
  item and never grepped here.
- **The `#NN` numerator caliber excludes the other tables' namespaces, and that changed the
  caliber of three rulers.** This product renders and teaches `E#N` / `P#N` / `D#N` / `S#N`;
  every injected-side extractor drops them by construction, and the cited side did not, so
  `E#501` read as observation 501 — on this machine 26/26 live observation ids are also event
  ids AND prompt ids. The old docblock argument ("a loose numerator is free, because a cited
  id only counts once it intersects an ANCHORED injected set") has one measured exception:
  `extractUserTypedIds` runs the same regex over the user's own message, so both sides of the
  intersection were unanchored. Same-tree A/B: **9 of 44 credited (session, id) pairs — 20.5%
  — came in through a namespace token.** `citationIdRe()` now carries `(?<![A-Za-z0-9])`.
  **Do not diff citation numbers across this change**: `benchmark/cite-recall.mjs` and
  `benchmark/efficacy-observational.mjs` import it directly and
  `benchmark/citation-live-replay.mjs` reaches it through `extractCitationsFromTranscript`.
  It deliberately does NOT catch `issue #1234` or `[link](#42)` — a digit after a space or
  `(` is indistinguishable from a citation at this layer.
- **`importance` is rewritten automatically by five writers** (`decayAndMarkIdle`,
  `demotePinned`, `recoverBuriedLessons`, `autoBoostIfNeeded`, and the `boost` maintain op
  via `access_count`). Citation decay no longer writes it (D#179/D#198) — do not read that
  as "importance is now stable".
- **Tool name mapping**: Claude Code Agent tool = `'Agent'` (not `'Task'`); Skill via
  `event.tool_input?.skill`.
- **Tests use `:memory:` DB** — schema changes must sync to test files.
- **Writing a test that reads repo source as TEXT: use `dirname(fileURLToPath(...))` +
  `join()`, never `new URL('../x.mjs', import.meta.url)`.** The URL form drops the named
  module out of knip's report entirely — one unrelated test file once blinded knip to a
  whole module. Guarded by `tests/no-url-module-paths.test.mjs`.
- **`effectiveQuiet()` drops both Key Context sections under this repo's own cwd** (it is
  adopted), so a test asserting on them passes vacuously — point `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` at an
  unadopted temp dir and assert a premise first. **Since report §9-A (2026-09-29,
  docs/audits/20260929-sandbox-usage-eval.md) a temp dir alone is not unadopted:** auto-adopt
  injects the steering instead of writing the block, and injected steering counts as adopted
  (`isSteeringInjectedHere`). The fixture also needs `MEM_NO_AUTO_ADOPT=1` (or the project's
  `.mem-no-auto-adopt` sentinel).
- Skill commands (`/search`, `/recall`, `/recent`, `/timeline`) use `!` preprocessing for
  CLI injection.
- **`MEM_NO_AUTO_ADOPT=1` is a GLOBAL opt-out and every auto-adopt caller must honour it.**
  `install.mjs`'s dogfood branch respected only `--no-adopt`, and because it detects this
  repo by its git REMOTE while adopt-cli resolves its TARGET from `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR ‖ PWD`,
  the unit suite rewrote this repository's own CLAUDE.md managed block and `.claude/`
  sidecar on every run (R9's "fourth trap"; R10 P2-17 found the writer). Any test that
  spawns `install.mjs install` or `repair` must set it —
  `tests/suite-touches-no-repo-files.test.mjs` scans for that and skips `doctor` / `status`
  / `uninstall` spawners, which cannot reach the adopt path.
- **`writeFileSync(path, data, { flag: 'wx' })` is TWO syscalls**, so the file is briefly
  visible EMPTY. Anything that treats an unparseable file as reclaimable — `proc-lock`'s
  `isStale` did — will steal a lock its owner is mid-way through creating. Fill a private
  temp and `linkSync` it into place instead; `link` is atomic, fails EEXIST exactly like
  O_EXCL, and never exposes the name without its contents (R10 P1-7).
- **A `project` column is not a substitute for a project CHECK on a write.** `resolveProject`
  is fuzzy by design for reads, where a wrong guess costs a query; write callers must pass
  `{ mode: 'write' }`, and cross-project operations (`mergeDuplicates`, the
  `normalize-project-names` cleanup) must compare the two rows' projects before acting.
  Both faces silently relocated user data before R10 P2-3 / P2-7 / P1-2.
- **`optimized_at` is the re-enrich pools' "seen it" flag and nothing else's.** Normalize
  used to stamp it as a side effect of replacing one concept term, evicting rows from a
  lesson backfill they had never visited (R10 P2-2). Before writing it, check you are the
  pass it belongs to.
- **Every re-enrich pool's predicate is some other pass's OUTPUT column, so filling a
  column EVICTS the row from whatever pool keyed on its emptiness.** This has now been
  found three times and the third one was created by the second one's fix, so treat it as
  a class, not an incident: `optimized_at` (R10 P2-2, above), `search_aliases` (P1-2), and
  `concepts` (D#6). `save-enrich` fires on every successful manual save and writes
  `search_aliases` + `lesson_learned` + `scope` — which are exactly narrow's, wide's,
  aliases' and scopes' predicates — so a save-enriched row matched **none of the four** and
  never received concepts. Measured on the real DB 2026-09-07: 16 live rows, 15
  conceptless, 16 with aliases, all four pools **0**. Its docblock's "the daily wide
  re-enrich stays the safety net" was true of `optimized_at` and false in effect.
  **Before adding a writer, ask which pool's WHERE clause that column is**; before adding a
  pool, key it on the column it fills and nothing else, so idempotency is "the thing I
  write becomes non-empty" (`aliases`, `scopes` and now `concepts` all do this, and all
  three are deliberately un-gated on `optimized_at`). Fixed by a pool, not by widening
  save-enrich's contract — a source-side fix cannot reach rows already on disk. Pool 0 → 14
  on the real corpus; the 15th is named, not subtracted (#44, 79-char narrative, below the
  substantive gate). Concepts are worth **+0.0846 R@10 / +0.0579 nDCG** where they exist
  (benchmark fixture, same-tree A/B) — against **+0.0002 R@10** for all eight scoring
  multipliers combined — but that is *what they are worth*, NOT what backfilling recovers
  in production, which is still unmeasured.
- **A prebuilt addon that is PRESENT and will not load cannot be healed by compiling one.**
  better-sqlite3 13's `lib/binding.js` picks `prebuilds/<target>.node` on **existence alone**
  and prefers it over `build/`, so whatever `npm run --prefix node_modules/better-sqlite3
  build-release` produces stays shadowed. Measured 2026-09-06 with a control: corrupt prebuild
  + healthy `build/Release` → `wrong ELF class`; prebuild moved aside → opens; neither → fails.
  Real triggers are a glibc too old for the shipped binary, a truncated download, the wrong
  arch baked into an image. Before the fix `rebuild-binding` exited 1 on that shape and printed
  a manual command with the same dead end, so `doctor` stayed red forever.
  `ensureBetterSqlite3Working` now renames the dead prebuild to `<name>.node.unusable` before
  the source build and puts it back if the compile did not help. **Only inside the source-build
  branch** — quarantining with no compile to follow turns "broken addon" into "no addon", and
  that branch is exactly what the 20 s SessionStart path opts out of (`sourceBuild: false`).
- **Never name the native addon's path — ask `lib/binding.js`'s `getPrebuildPath()`.** The
  literal has now gone stale twice on one dependency bump: `tests/install-bsqlite-probe.test.mjs`
  (caught by its control) and both sandbox phases (caught by nothing for four minor versions).
- **Deep search answers questions the corpus cannot answer, and the recall ruler cannot
  see it.** Measured 2026-09-06 with `benchmark/deep-search-holdout.mjs` (the suite's own
  queries asked of a corpus with their `relevant_ids` deleted): **mean FP@10 = 10.00,
  12/12 queries flooded** — every slot filled, every time. **The flood is NOT the paraphrase
  union.** This bullet used to say the single-query baseline returns 1-2 rows on the same
  negatives and that the union fills the page; measured 2026-09-07 on the same fixture, the
  single-variant baseline already returns **mean 9.42 of 10** (min 5, max 10, n=12), so
  fusion adds about half a slot to a page that was full. A counterfactual names the real
  source: disabling the AND→OR fallback in `search-engine.mjs` takes **mean FP@10 from 10.00
  to 0.08**, 0/12 queries flooded instead of 12/12 (mutation applied and reverted, checksums
  both ways). That is a MECHANISM PROBE, not a candidate fix — the same fallback is the
  vocab-mismatch recall win, per the rejected gate #1 below. `rrfFuseN` fuses by RANK, so no
  magnitude signal survives into the merge for a downstream floor to act on. The user-visible shape: `search "kubernetes
  helm chart"` correctly says *No results*, and `--deep` on the same query returns 8 of 13
  webshop memories. **`mem_search`'s `deep` is AUTO by default** (`resolveDeepMode`,
  surface `mcp`), and auto-escalation fires exactly when the normal search was weak — i.e.
  precisely when the honest answer is "nothing". **Three gates were tested against BOTH
  arms and rejected** — do not re-propose one without running the holdout ruler AND
  `tests/benchmark-deep-search.test.mjs`; the ruler's docblock names all three and why,
  the headline being that suppressing OR-fallback on rewrites takes deep R@10 from 0.7383
  to 0.3962 because **the vocab-mismatch win IS OR-fallback on rewrites**. The signal
  analysis says the discrimination is not available at this layer: with the right rows
  deleted the engine returns the next-most-adjacent rows, and on vm-7/vm-8/vm-12 the
  holdout arm scores at or ABOVE the positive arm on every quantity `deepSearch` can see.
- **The AND→OR fallback DISARMS auto-escalation, so both deep-search rulers are blind to
  the `auto` policy and every number they report describes EXPLICIT deep** (D#8, measured
  2026-09-07, `main`, `seed-data.json` + the 12 vocab-mismatch queries). Auto fires when the
  plain observation search returns fewer than `AUTO_DEEP_MIN_RESULTS` (3) rows — a COUNT —
  while the OR fallback exists precisely to make that count non-zero. It fires on **12/12
  queries in both populations** — one fixture, `seed-data.json`, read two ways: the holdout
  population with each query's `relevant_ids` deleted, and the full population with nothing
  deleted. They are two derived populations, not two independent datasets (doctrine rule 3).
  The plain count at the pipeline's own window
  (`computePerSourceWindow` = `max(limit*3, 60)`, NOT `deepSearch`'s internal
  `max(limit, 20)`) reads **min 5 / mean 21.42 on the holdout arm**, with the full corpus
  the same shape. `shouldEscalateToDeep` is therefore **false on 12/12, both arms**.
  **Consequence for anyone planning an escalation-policy A/B**: D#8's two arms (escalate at
  `hits < 3` vs at `1 <= hits < 3`) would read IDENTICALLY here, and that Δ=0 is a blind
  instrument, not a verdict — doctrine rule 9, the same trap D#14 closed on. The reach is
  now printed by the ruler and pinned by `tests/deep-search.test.mjs`, so a fixture that
  gains an escalating query goes red instead of being silently absent. **Also corrected
  here**: the holdout ruler's docblock claimed "the single-query baseline returns 1-2 rows
  on the same negatives". It does not reproduce — the single-variant baseline reads
  **mean 9.42 of 10** (min 5, max 10, n=12) against deep's 10.00, so paraphrase union adds
  about half a slot to a page that was already full. Provenance of the 1-2 figure could not
  be established; recorded as not reproducing rather than explained (doctrine rule 10).
- **A metric named after the thing is not a measurement of the thing — the TF-IDF vector arm
  was retired in v3.17.0 on a number that never touched it.** That release cited
  `benchmark/ci-gate.mjs: hybrid_over_bm25 = 0` as "~0 lift" for the vector arm. Checked
  2026-09-07: `benchmark/benchmark.mjs:300` defines `hybrid` as the eight SCORING MULTIPLIERS
  over BM25, `:676` computes the delta against `bm25_only`, and `:611` shows
  `production_hybrid` — the only mode that runs the real `searchObservationsHybrid` — is not
  in the matrix at all. Neither term of that delta executes a vector path, so the citation
  could not have said yes OR no. **The word "hybrid" means two different things in this repo**
  (multiplier-hybrid in the matrix, FTS+vector-hybrid in the function name), and that collision
  is what made a wrong citation read as a right one for 2.5 months.
  The verdict survived re-measurement — the same release ALSO ran the correct instrument, and
  a same-tree A/B reproduces it to the digit (`--production-hybrid` R@10 0.8998 off / 0.8980
  on) with a column v3.17.0 never reported (P@10 0.8497 → 0.7819) and a latency cost of
  **+72% at the median of 5 runs** (2.2724 → 3.9037ms),
  while the vocabulary-mismatch fixture, where the ruler is far from saturated and CAN say no,
  reads negative on every column (R@10 0.3407 → 0.3018, −11.4%). **So the lesson is not "the
  decision was wrong" — it is that a decision can be right and its stated evidence still be
  incapable of supporting it.** Before quoting a gate number as evidence about a subsystem,
  open the ruler and check which arms it actually executes (doctrine rules 9 and 10).
- **`benchmark:gate` CANNOT say NO about the eight scoring multipliers, and its zeros are
  a blind instrument, not dead weight.** Both halves measured 2026-09-07 at `main` @
  f25e8ae. The gate's only multiplier check is `hybrid_over_bm25` with floor **−0.05**,
  and the reading is **+0.0002 R@10 / +0.0055 nDCG** — so the entire chain can degrade to
  pure BM25 and stay 0.05 above the floor. The eight per-term ablation deltas `--matrix`
  prints are gated by **nothing**. Proven by mutating the real tree and reverting it
  (checksums verified both ways): neutering `MULT_EXPR.importance` to a constant left the
  gate at **exit 0, all four checks PASS**, with `hybrid_over_bm25` going **UP** (R 0.0002
  → 0.0019) because importance is a NEGATIVE contributor on this fixture; changing
  `MULT_EXPR.lesson`'s 0.3 to 0.5 left the gate's output **byte-identical, every digit**.
  The cause is a saturated corpus — `bm25_only` alone reads R@10 0.8996 / P@10 0.9731 —
  plus axes the fixture cannot vary: `seed-data.json` carries **no** `access_count`,
  `lesson_learned`, or cite/noise counters, and 29 of 30 queries set no project while the
  one that does also FILTERS on it, which makes the boost rank-invariant. **Do not read
  `drop X → Δ=0` as "X is dead weight"** — `scoring-sql.mjs`'s old note blamed a
  "single-project fixture", which is false (5 projects × 40 rows). Use
  `benchmark/multiplier-discrimination.mjs`: tied-BM25 pairs recover each multiplier's own
  ratio, and **all eight are alive with their declared magnitude** (decay 1.9770, type
  1.8333, project 2.0000, importance 2.0000, access 1.5004, lesson 1.3000, noise 5.0000,
  cite 2.0000). Retuning a constant in `scoring-sql.mjs` or `MULT_EXPR` requires re-running
  that ruler; the aggregate gate will not notice. **Still open, and a different question:
  whether these priors help a real user** — "wired up" is not "calibrated". **What is now
  settled is that this question is NOT answerable on this machine, and the blocker is the
  corpus, not the instrument** (D#14, measured 2026-09-07, read-only). Do not re-derive it, and
  do not start building an eval before re-running its two denominators. The whole real corpus
  is **32 live observations** (claude-mem-lite 14 / code-graph-mcp 13 / claudemd 5), counted
  with the shipped `liveObsFilterSql` on a readonly handle, 2026-09-08T23:22Z. **That figure is
  a snapshot of a corpus every session grows, this one included — re-count it, never diff it
  against the number printed here** (doctrine rule 2): the same denominator read 21 on
  2026-09-07, 26 earlier on 2026-09-08 (D#23) and 32 by that evening. The distance to the
  reopen threshold below is what matters, and it has not meaningfully closed. The only
  real relevance labels available are citations, and `citation-live-replay` over all 47
  transcripts yields **59 (session, id) pairs, 23 cited** — which sounds workable and is not,
  because a pairwise ranking metric can only score a **cited × uncited pair inside one session
  and one face**, and that product is **25**, from 6 mixed sessions. Then the decisive cut:
  **24 of those 25 come from `error_recall`, which ranks by `bm25 × decay`** (see
  `lib/error-recall-core.mjs`'s own comment that `rows[0]` is the bm25×decay RANK-top) **and
  never touches the eight-multiplier chain**; the multiplier-bearing faces contribute **1**, and
  the only query-bearing face, `ups`, contributes **0**. LongMemEval is not the substitute it
  looks like: `benchmark/datasets/README.md` states the adapter holds decay / project-boost /
  importance CONSTANT on purpose, and the dataset carries none of the columns the other five
  multipliers read — that makes it **BLIND, not a source of DEAD verdicts**, the exact misreading
  the tied-pair ruler exists to prevent. Reopen when the corpus reaches ~500 live observations
  **and** the mixed-session contrast pairs reach ~200; at 25 pairs the 95% CI on pairwise
  accuracy is about ±20 points, which cannot separate 0.5 from 0.6.
- **A long LLM round-trip needs `liveObsFilterSql` in the UPDATE's WHERE, not just in the
  SELECT that chose the row.** 45 seconds is long enough for a concurrent hook to supersede
  or compress it, and an unguarded write resurrects a dead row AND stamps it processed
  (R10 P3-3). Treat `changes === 0` as a skip, not a success. **R10 fixed the general
  branch and stopped there; a 2026-09-07 sweep of all 11 observation writes in
  `hook-optimize.mjs` found two siblings still bare (D#12), and one of them is worse than a
  stale write.** The importance:0 auto-hide sets `compressed_into = COMPRESSED_AUTO (-1)`,
  and `compressed_into` is the child → keeper POINTER: if a concurrent merge/compress adopts
  the row mid-call it holds a POSITIVE keeper id, and −1 over that destroys the link, since
  `lib/maintain-core.mjs:316` recovers orphans with `compressed_into > 0` and
  `recoverChildrenOf` follows the same id. The sibling write at `lib/maintain-core.mjs:631`
  already carried the predicate, so **when one write of a pair is guarded, check the other
  before assuming it is a design choice.** Two of the eleven looked bare and were not
  (`:941/:947` sit inside a transaction that re-checks keeper liveness first) — read the
  surrounding block, do not grep for the predicate.
- **The daily unattended `normalize` was the one path where ONE observation's content could
  rewrite rows in EVERY project. It is closed STRUCTURALLY — an unscoped run now fans out to
  one scoped pass per project — and the two rounds it took to get there are the lesson**
  (R10-P3-21 tier 3, 2026-09-08). The chain, by NAME because the first write-up of this
  bullet cited eight line numbers and six were already wrong within the same commit:
  `hook.mjs` `handleLLMOptimize` → `optimizeRun(db, {reenrichScope:'wide'})` **passing no
  `project`** → `executeNormalize(db, force, {project: undefined})` → `extractUniqueConcepts`
  over every project → one prompt → `applyNormalization` writing every project.
  `applyNormalization`'s own comment has said since v2.72.0 that `--project` exists to
  prevent exactly this; the unattended caller was simply still using the legacy unscoped mode.
  **THE FIRST FIX DID NOT WORK AND THE WAY IT FAILED IS THE REUSABLE PART.** It kept the
  single union pass and policed the model's ANSWER: every returned `canonical` and `alias`
  had to be a member of the input concept set. Independent review broke it in one line — that
  set is built from `concepts`, which is what an attacker writes to, so storing `pwned` among
  their OWN concepts makes it a legitimate member. The victim row read
  `"pwned pagination coverage"`, byte-identical to the pre-fix reproduction. **Any
  corpus-derived whitelist has this shape**: if the attacker can write to the corpus, they can
  write to the whitelist. Worse, the hole had been noticed during design and then lost,
  because the test was written to the FIX (a canonical the corpus never had) rather than to
  the THREAT (a canonical the attacker put there) — which is how it passed and bought
  confidence it had not earned.
  **What the fan-out costs, stated rather than buried**: the default path no longer unifies
  vocabulary ACROSS projects, so `k8s` here and `kubernetes` there stay separate. Restore the
  old behaviour with `CLAUDE_MEM_NORMALIZE_CROSS_PROJECT=1` — which **restores the SCOPE, not
  the pre-fix content handling**: layer 1's shape gate and layer 3's answer filter both run on
  the legacy path too (`extractUniqueConcepts` and `identifySynonymGroups` apply them
  unconditionally), so "restores the old pass exactly" is wrong in the safe direction and was
  corrected rather than left. **Do not read that as "the other two layers still protect the
  legacy path"** — pre-tag review caught the over-read: with no `project`, layer 3's `known`
  set is the UNION of every project's vocabulary, which is precisely the corpus-derived
  whitelist round 1 broke. On that path the fan-out is the guard, and the flag is what turns
  it off; layer 3 degrades to "a term some project had". It warns on stderr **only for a foreground caller**; see the
  two-blocker bullet below for why the unattended path cannot, and `doctor` for where that
  disclosure actually lives. **That flag is the only route back** — an explicit `optimize --run --task
  normalize` with no `--project` is an unscoped run too and fans out as well, which the README,
  the CHANGELOG and the source comment all claimed otherwise until review checked. Bounded to
  `NORMALIZE_MAX_PROJECTS_PER_RUN` (8) passes per run, since each is an LLM call where the union
  pass was one.
  **What real concepts look like** (2026-09-08, three populations): real DB 1 row with
  concepts / 10 distinct / max 13, `seed-data.json` 200 rows / 541 / max 22,
  `seed-data-cjk.json` 31 rows / 55 / max 9. **UNION 598** — the sum is 606 and calling the
  sum "distinct" was doctrine rule 4 in miniature; the populations overlap by 8. Longest is
  `infrastructure-as-code` (22); zero contain a denied character. The real-DB arm cannot
  calibrate anything on its own.
  **The remaining layers, each independently mutation-killed** (14 mutations, each asserted to
  have LANDED first): (1) `isConceptShaped` gates SHAPE where stored content becomes model
  input — length 2..40, a per-row cap of 32 so one row cannot monopolise the pool, a
  **denylist stated as a PROPERTY, not a list** — `\p{Default_Ignorable_Code_Point}` is Unicode's
  own name for "present in the text, absent from the rendering", plus the surrogate,
  private-use and separator categories, plus U+2800 BRAILLE PATTERN BLANK (a real graphic
  character that renders blank, so Unicode rightly does not call it ignorable). An NFKC fold
  judged against the punctuation class ONLY. Never a `\w` allowlist (ASCII-only in JS: it eats
  `café`). (2) `{system, user}` + `MEMORY_INPUT_GUARD`. (3) membership of the model's answer in
  **that project's** vocabulary, case-insensitively, matching `aliasMap`'s own lowercasing.
  **THREE hand-drawn versions of that class each rejected real text, which is why it is now a
  property.** `[\u0000-\u001F]` stopped at U+001F and let U+0085 NEL and the C1 block through.
  `\p{Cf}` swept up U+200C ZWNJ and U+200D ZWJ — required orthography in Persian and Hindi;
  they are stripped via `\p{Join_Control}` (exactly those two) before the test, at the stated
  cost that a phrase joined with them is one token, bounded by the fan-out to the attacker's own
  project. And `\p{Cf}` ALSO swept up **U+0600, U+0601, U+06DD, U+070F and U+08E2 — Arabic and
  Syriac format characters that are real orthography and are not default-ignorable**; NEITHER
  review round caught that, it turned up only by asking what `\p{Cf}` actually contains instead
  of trusting the class name. `\p{Cn}` is absent, and the reason is DIRECTION, not stability —
  both classes track the runtime's Unicode version. An older runtime calls a newly-assigned
  character unassigned, so `\p{Cn}` would REJECT real orthography (unbounded, on the user's
  own text); an older runtime merely has not heard of a newly-added default-ignorable, so
  this class ACCEPTS one it should not — bounded by the fan-out and by layer 3. The NFKC fold is punct-ONLY because applying
  the invisible classes to the folded form rejected `caf´e` — the keyboard spacing acute folds
  to space + accent and space is `\p{Zs}`, i.e. this bullet's own `café` example failing its own
  gate.
  **The 8-project cap ROTATES** (cursor in the gate file, resuming after the last project
  handled). The first version sliced the head off a deterministic ordering with nothing
  advancing between runs, so past the cap the ninth project was never normalized at all, while
  the CHANGELOG told users each one still was. **It is guarded BOTH ways, and the first attempt was
  only half of it**: a unit test on `pickProjectsToNormalize` proves the function, and an
  end-to-end case with a PRIVATE gate file (`CLAUDE_MEM_RUNTIME_DIR` + `vi.resetModules` +
  dynamic import) proves anything calls it. Without the second, both halves of the wiring were
  mutable with the whole suite green. The flake that drove the unit-only version was real — the
  gate file is shared by every project and every concurrent run — but a private runtime dir
  removes it, so "it was flaky" was not a reason to leave the wiring untested.
  **Toggling the escape hatch must not reset the cursor**: a bare `advanceNormalizeGate()`
  writes `cursor: null`, sending the next fan-out back to the head.
  **The escape hatch's warning had TWO blockers and the first repair removed one of them, so
  it still fired zero times.** Round 2 moved it off `debugLog` (returns early unless
  `CLAUDE_MEM_DEBUG` is set, which the detached worker does not set) to a bare
  `console.error` — and the test certifying that repair spied on `console.error` IN PROCESS,
  which proves the function emits, not that anyone receives. Nobody does: `hook.mjs` reaches
  this path via `spawnBackground('llm-optimize')`, and `hook-shared.mjs` spawns with
  `stdio: 'ignore'`, so the child's fd 2 IS `/dev/null`. **The unattended path has no stderr
  at all** — any future "warn the user" on a `spawnBackground` path is dead on arrival, so
  route it to a surface the USER runs: the disclosure now lives in `doctor` as a ⚠
  (`dwarn`, so exit stays 0), alongside the `CLAUDE_MEM_SKIP_SIG_VERIFY` precedent. The
  `console.error` stays and is correct for the foreground `optimize --run --task normalize`
  path; `tests/normalize-cross-project-disclosure.test.mjs` pins both channels plus a
  tripwire on the `stdio: 'ignore'` premise. Generalise it as: **an in-process spy on a
  logger is not evidence that the log is delivered** — ask what fd the process that runs it
  actually has.
  **Do not restate this as "three layers, remove any one and it re-opens"** — that was the
  first write-up and it overstated layer 2, which the same bullet then contradicted by calling
  it defense-in-depth wiring rather than a behavioural guarantee (#8605: prompt wording barely
  moves the model). Layer 1 is the one that stops the primitive, the fan-out is the one that
  stops the cross-project reach, and layer 3 now stops the model introducing a term the
  PROJECT never had — not a determined attacker, which is what it was wrongly credited with.
  **Two premises that sound obvious and are false**, both load-bearing in the first attempt:
  a payload does NOT have to be one token (`concepts` is stored as `array.join(' ')` and
  re-joined with `', '`, so a multi-element array reads back as a phrase), and JS `\s` is NOT
  "whitespace" but a FIXED LIST — U+200B, U+0085 NEL, U+00AD, U+2060, U+007F and the whole C1
  block are outside it, so a phrase joined with any of them survives the split as one token.
  U+FEFF and U+00A0 ARE in it. Check, do not assume.
  **`MEMORY_INPUT_GUARD` lives in `lib/memory-input-guard.mjs`** because normalization made it
  a second consumer and a hand-copied security control is this repo's twin-drift class. **Do
  not merge it with `deep-search.mjs`'s `INJECTION_GUARD`** — different sentence, different
  input (the live query, not stored content), #8729's import-weight reason still holds, and
  `tests/memory-input-guard.test.mjs` pins the separation so the next tidy-up argues with a
  test.
- **An `if (x)` guard whose else-branch is a LOOSER RULE is not a fallback, it is a second
  policy nobody reviewed — and deleting the `if` does not delete the problem, it promotes
  it.** `clusterForCompression` was the one site where a null TF-IDF vocabulary, instead of
  making the vector path *skip*, fell through to grouping by a **14-day window alone, with no
  similarity check**. Because the arm was default-off, that looser branch was ALREADY the only
  reachable path, running unattended (`hook.mjs:1940` → `handleLLMOptimize` passes no `tasks`).
  Measured 2026-09-07 with a control arm, three observations sharing only project and era, 12
  days apart: **arm on → 0 clusters, arm off → 1 cluster of all three.** Not observed in
  production here (0 eligible rows on this corpus), so it is a demonstrated mechanism, not an
  incident. **Phase-2 then removed the vector arm, which makes the loose branch the only
  branch by construction — production behaviour unchanged, review surface reduced to one
  path, and the control arm above no longer re-runnable.** Read the reading with that
  expiry: it is the last measurement of a comparison that no longer exists. **And the two LLM cluster
  paths disagreed about whether the model may refuse**: `executeMergeCluster` has always had
  `should_merge`; `executeSmartCompressCluster` had no veto and a prompt that *asserted*
  relatedness — on the path that HIDES its inputs. It now fails CLOSED on a missing verdict
  (D#10 option b), because refusing wrongly costs a skipped compression while proceeding
  wrongly hides real rows. **Option (a) — make the null-vocabulary branch skip outright — is
  OPEN and deliberately not taken**: it would disable smart-compress on the default config,
  a released-artifact user-visible default behaviour change. **The condition for revisiting
  (a) was to measure the veto first, and that measurement now exists**
  (`benchmark/compress-veto-rate.mjs`, 2026-09-07, openrouter-routed sonnet, run twice
  back-to-back with identical results): **veto rate 6/6 = 100% on the unrelated arm,
  false-refusal 0/6 = 0% on the related arm, 0 errors.** Read the bound with the number:
  n=6 per arm, a HAND-BUILT fixture (the real corpus has zero eligible rows, so there is
  nothing to sample), and the two arms are separated by design — lexical cohesion 0.1124 vs
  0.0051, which a self-check asserts. So this says the veto handles the CLEAR case, which is
  exactly the D#10 shape. **The ruler classifies THREE ways on purpose** — a refusal, a
  compression, and an *error* — because the shipped function returns `{compressed:false}` for
  a refusal and for a dead key alike, so a two-way ruler would have scored a broken API key
  as a perfect veto.
  **The ambiguous arm that was "the named next step" now exists and has been read** (D#13,
  2026-09-07): 6 partly-one-story clusters, cohesion asserted STRICTLY between the other two
  arms' (0.0051 < 0.0333 < 0.1124, mutation-verified by aliasing the fixture to UNRELATED —
  reads FAIL, exit 1), and **the veto is DECISIVE on them: 6/6 clusters gave the same verdict
  every time, 0 flipped, splitting 3 refuse / 3 compress, 0 errors.** Read that with its
  caliber, because the arm's FIRST version was withdrawn over exactly this:
  **`DEFAULT_LLM_TEMPERATURE` is pinned to 0** (`haiku-client.mjs:57`) and the shipped path
  takes that default, so asking an identical prompt three times is close to asking it once,
  and the 1.000 it produced was near-tautological — the header's own blind-instrument hazard,
  reintroduced one layer above the three-way classification that exists to stop it. The reps
  therefore **rotate member order**, a variation production actually exhibits (untiebroken
  pools, D#9 — since fixed in `hook-optimize.mjs`), so the arm answers *is the verdict
  invariant to presentation order* rather than *does a temperature-0 model repeat itself*.
  Premise carried, not assumed: `distinctOrders` per cluster, `minDistinctOrders` per arm, a
  self-check requiring it to equal reps, and a deliberately reachable `permute: false` mode
  asserted to read 1 so that check can be shown to fail. **This evidence argues AGAINST taking
  option (a), which is now a DECISION rather than a measurement gap** (D#16): on exactly the
  population the 14-day fallback produces, the veto refuses half and allows half, decisively
  and order-independently, so (a) would throw away three correct compressions to prevent a
  hiding the veto is already preventing. Stability is not correctness — that arm has no ground
  truth — so it says *repeatable and order-invariant*, never *right*.
- **`package.json`'s `os` field is an npm INSTALL gate, and in plugin mode it sits on the
  path of every MCP launch after an update.** It is not a runtime check and not
  documentation: npm exits `EBADPLATFORM` before resolving anything. `scripts/launch.mjs`
  runs `npm install --omit=dev` whenever `node_modules/better-sqlite3` is absent, and Claude
  Code materializes each new plugin-cache version WITHOUT `node_modules` — so that install is
  not a first-run event, it is a post-every-update event. `os: ["darwin","linux"]` therefore
  did not warn Windows users, it killed the stdio server: `/mcp` said `CONNECTION_CLOSED`
  and the launcher's catch printed a fixed three-cause list that could not contain the real
  cause (issue #28, shipped v5.1.0 through v6.1.0). **The intent recorded in the commit that
  added it (`b6a2579`, R10 P3-19) was the opposite of its effect** — "a Windows user should
  be told rather than handed a string of silent catch blocks" — which is the reusable part:
  a gate is not a message, and a control whose only output is a failure the user cannot
  attribute has told them nothing. **Nothing about Windows was ever measured to be broken**;
  `better-sqlite3` 13 ships `win32-x64` and `win32-arm64` prebuilds, and the MCP server, the
  CLI and the `node` hooks are Node-only. What IS platform-bound is narrower and now has its
  own check: 3 of the 11 hook commands in `hooks/hooks.json` are `bash "…"`, so `doctor`
  reports whether **bash runs** — the real condition — rather than whether the platform is
  `win32`, the proxy. Keying on the condition is also what makes it testable here: emptying
  `PATH` reproduces it on Linux, where faking `process.platform` would reproduce only the
  proxy. **That check has to ask which registration is LIVE, and the first cut did not**
  (pre-ship review P1-1). `hooks/hooks.json` is in `RELEASE_SIGNED_FILES` but NOT in
  `SOURCE_FILES`, so the npm / npx / `git clone` install has no `hooks/` directory — and that
  is exactly the shape registering its bash hooks through `settings.json` (3 of them since v6.14.0, not 4 — `setup.sh` has no settings.json twin).
  Reading only the manifest therefore printed a green *"no hook command needs bash"* on the
  one shape where they are live, while both shipped READMEs promise `claude-mem-lite doctor`
  reports it — and that binary is the `~/.local/bin` symlink pointing at exactly the copy
  with no manifest. `resolveBashHookCount` now returns **three outcomes, never two**: a count
  of zero is reportable only when a registration was actually read, and "I could not find
  one" gets its own ⚠ naming both paths it looked at. Generalise it as **a diagnostic that
  says "nothing to check" and "I could not look" in the same voice is worse than silence** —
  silence leaves the reader searching, a green line ends the search.
- **A recovery path must not import the thing it recovers. One import edge — for two PATH
  CONSTANTS — put the signature-verified repair out of reach on exactly the broken install it
  exists to repair.** `hook-update.mjs` took `DB_DIR` / `CODE_DIR` from `schema.mjs`, which
  statically imports `better-sqlite3`; so on a tree with no `node_modules`,
  `install.mjs::repair()`'s `await import('./hook-update.mjs')` threw `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`,
  its fail-closed catch refused to auto-install unverified code, and the printed fallback was
  the unverified default-branch tarball that the same function's comment says it replaced.
  Measured 2026-09-08 in a `mktemp` tree with no `node_modules` above it: the import fails
  naming `schema.mjs`; with that one edge cut it loads with 18 exports and all five release
  functions. **The generalisable part is the SHAPE, not the file**: a constant is not free —
  importing one drags in its module's entire load-time graph, and a module that only ever
  needed a path was reaching a native addon. The three constants now live in
  `lib/data-paths.mjs` (a leaf: `node:` builtins plus `lib/resolve-data-dir.mjs`), and
  `schema.mjs` re-exports all three so no importer changed.
  `tests/repair-path-no-native-dep.test.mjs` walks the STATIC import graph from
  `hook-update.mjs` with acorn and fails on ANY package edge — a regex walk is not usable
  here, because a commented-out import reads as a live edge (audit 2026-09-05 P2-9) — plus a
  behavioural spawn against a real `node_modules`-free copy with a premise control that
  `schema.mjs` still fails there, so the behavioural half cannot pass vacuously.
  **Do not read the fail-closed catch as the defect**; it is correct and stays. What was
  wrong is that it was the ONLY reachable branch, and that the escape hatch it prints is
  weaker than the path it guards. That hatch now resolves the latest RELEASE tag, and it has
  four hand-copied homes (`install.mjs`, `scripts/hook-launcher.mjs`, `README.md`,
  `README.zh-CN.md`) pinned by `tests/manual-fallback-sync.test.mjs` — which compares the
  launcher's PARSED literal, not the source text, because the command contains single quotes
  and a raw `includes()` can never match a JS-escaped string.
- **A database file SQLite will not open is the schema-skew shape with the destructive
  remedy, and the in-session surface was the only silent one.** Every other surface already
  reported it correctly — CLI `search`/`recent`/`stats`/`get`/`save`/`browse`/`fts-check` all
  exit 1, `status` says "exists but check failed", `doctor` prints the exact repair command —
  while hooks returned null and ended SessionStart with **empty stdout AND empty stderr**, one
  ~860-byte stack trace per SessionStart fire, forever (measured 2026-09-08: 20 fires → 20
  records; an earlier draft said "20 fires → 10 records, ~1.5 KB" and BOTH terms were wrong —
  it was a mixed fire set reported as if it were 20 SessionStarts, at a size nobody measured).
  Fixed the same way as skew: `lib/db-unusable.mjs` + `lib/record-once.mjs` (the dedup body,
  extracted from `shouldRecordSkew` so the two cannot drift), record once per project per hour,
  and speak at SessionStart. Four things that cost a review round each:
  - **THE MESSAGE CANNOT TELL A DAMAGED INDEX FROM A DAMAGED FILE.** SQLite reports a damaged
    FTS5 index as `SQLITE_CORRUPT_VTAB` with the *same* `database disk image is malformed` text,
    and `schema.mjs`'s own docblock has said since R10 P3-9 that "matching on message alone is
    what conflated them". The first cut of `isDbUnusableError` matched on message alone and
    would have offered `cp <old snapshot> <db>` **over a database whose rows are all intact**.
    `isFtsCorruptionError` now lives in `lib/db-unusable.mjs` (schema.mjs re-exports it, so no
    importer changed) and gates it. Reachability was argued from the code path, not reproduced:
    better-sqlite3 runs with SQLite defensive mode on, so shadow-table writes are refused and a
    live VTAB could not be constructed.
  - **The two channels must NOT carry the same string here.** The skew twin sends one notice to
    both because its commands are `git pull` / `plugin update`. This one's is
    `rm -f …-wal …-shm && cp "<snapshot>" "<db>"`, which overwrites the database — so
    `queueHookSystemMessage` gets the command and `queueHookContext` gets
    `formatDbUnusableModelNotice`, which contains no shell at all. Handing a ready-to-run
    irreversible line to an agent holding Bash is not the same act as printing it for a human,
    and the restore arm defeats its own "keep the broken file for inspection" advice if acted on.
  - **A new per-project marker must be registered in `GC_PROJECT_MARKER_PREFIXES`.** Missing it
    leaks one file per project forever — R10 P3-5 exactly, and the note recording R10 P3-5 sits
    two entries above where the new prefix belongs.
  - **Extracting a function out of a catch block can silently drop its TOTAL contract.** Moving
    `shouldRecordSkew`'s key derivation outside the try made a hostile `info` propagate out of
    `openDb()`'s catch — unreachable from either caller, but `hook-shared.mjs` asserts the
    property, not the reachability. Same shape as the `getSessionId()` incident.

- **A DB written by a NEWER claude-mem-lite locks every older code home out, permanently,
  and until v6.3.0 it did so in silence.** `schema.mjs`'s forward-incompat guard (v2.41) is
  correct — replaying old migrations over a newer layout would corrupt the store — but it is
  a one-way ratchet: the only repair is getting newer code. Measured here 2026-09-08: DB
  **v49**, live plugin cache **5.6.0** (supports v48), because the dev tree had opened the
  shared `~/.claude-mem-lite` DB. Result was **≥648 identical lines in one day** in
  `runtime/hook-errors/`, still growing (a second reading minutes later read 727 — doctrine
  rule 2 happening inside the measurement); the MCP server died before its handshake so the
  host said only `-32000 Connection closed`; and `hook.mjs`'s `const db = openDb(); if (!db)
  return;` ended SessionStart in silence. **The plugin could not self-heal and the reason was
  one level further out**: the local marketplace clone `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/sdsrss`
  was itself pinned at v5.6.0, **22 commits behind** `origin/main`, so Claude Code's updater
  had nothing newer to install. `syncDataDirFromCache` does not help — it runs the OTHER
  direction (cache new → data dir old) and its docblock's premise, "the plugin cache is kept
  current by Claude Code's marketplace updater", is exactly what a stale clone falsifies.
  **The remedy is SHAPE-DEPENDENT and the thrown message gets it wrong for the shape that
  actually hits this**: it says `npm i -g claude-mem-lite@latest`, inert on a plugin cache.
  `lib/schema-skew.mjs` computes it instead — and from the ROOT that is behind, not the
  machine's global shape, because `hasManagedCodeInstall` is true for anyone who ALSO has a
  managed install and for a dev checkout (`existsSync` follows symlinks), which printed
  `self-update` beneath a line naming the plugin cache. **Do not enumerate the surfaces here
  — grep the importers of `lib/schema-skew.mjs`**; a hardcoded count is the stale enumeration
  this file has been burned by before, and the first cut of this work missed
  `scripts/user-prompt-search.js`, which opens the DB itself and contributed 15 of one day's
  727 lines. Three things that cost a review round each: **(a)** the dedup marker must be
  per PROJECT — one file keyed on a per-project session id let two projects overwrite each
  other and record on every fire (8 fires / 2 projects → 8 records); **(b)** nothing called
  from `openDb`'s catch may throw, and `getSessionId()` is not a read — it MINTS and writes a
  session id, so an unwritable runtime dir turned `openDb()` itself into a thrower; **(c)**
  the notice belongs on `queueHookSystemMessage`, the HUMAN channel — `queueHookContext`
  reaches the model, which is the mistake `lib/hook-stdout.mjs` already names v3.70.0 for
  ("kept its content and lost its audience"). **What this fix cannot do**: help a machine
  already running the old code, since the detection ships in the newer version. The one
  exception is `doctor`, which probes each code home out of process — so new code diagnoses
  an old cache, and that is the half that works today.
  **Before adding a manifest field that npm or a host enforces, ask which failure the
  user actually sees.** `lib/platform-gate.mjs` reproduces npm's own `checkList`, negation
  included — `list.includes(platform)` agrees on the simple case and is wrong on `["!win32"]`
  in the direction that tells a correct platform it is unsupported. Windows is still NOT
  CI-covered (no runner exists), so the README claims "installs", not "supported".
- **A structural sweep is only as wide as the population it enumerates, and that population
  is written down once and then trusted forever.** `tests/shipped-tree.mjs`'s `walkShipped`
  is documented as "Every shipped `.mjs`/`.js` module", and every sweep built on it inherits
  that filter — including `tests/runtime-dir-single-home.test.mjs`, whose whole subject is
  the defect FORM "a shipped module builds `join(…, 'runtime')` itself instead of asking the
  resolver". Three shipped bash hooks (`scripts/setup.sh`, `post-tool-use.sh`,
  `pre-agent-inject.sh`) are structurally outside it, and `setup.sh` is the FIRST hook
  SessionStart runs. That is where two instances of the exact defect the sweep exists to
  catch lived through twelve audit rounds, measured 2026-09-14:
  - `setup.sh` wrote `.deps-broken` to `$HOME/.claude-mem-lite/runtime` while `hook.mjs`
    renders it from `join(RUNTIME_DIR, …)`, i.e. `resolveRuntimeDir(resolveDataDir(
    CLAUDE_MEM_DIR))`. Two arms: flag planted where the writer writes → the "hooks are
    degraded" banner rendered **0** times; planted where the reader reads → **1**. Under a
    relocation the only surface that reports hook degradation was silent.
  - The same one-variable-for-three-locations confusion sent both database migrations at
    `CODE_DIR`. The legacy `~/.claude-mem/` backup is gated on "no `claude-mem-lite.db`
    here yet", which under a relocation nothing ever falsifies — the product creates the
    database in `DB_DIR`. Three SessionStarts with the product creating its own database
    in between: control arm **1** backup and stable, relocated arm **1 → 3**, one full copy
    of the legacy database per session start without bound. This is the THIRD outing of the
    `DB_DIR` / `CODE_DIR` confusion in this repo (v6.3.0, then that fix reintroduced with
    the halves swapped, then here), which is why `setup.sh` now spells all three location
    names out with the reason each does or does not follow the override.

  Two rules come out of it. **Read a structural guard's population before its criteria** —
  a correct criterion over the wrong population is indistinguishable from a clean sweep, and
  a file type missing from the population must be an explicit, written exception rather than
  a default. And **fix this class with behavioural guards, not text scans**: a scan of
  `setup.sh` would have been one more ruler carrying the same blind spot.
  `tests/setup-sh-deps-flag-relocation.test.mjs` and
  `tests/setup-sh-legacy-db-relocation.test.mjs` instead observe which file the live
  `mark_deps_ok` branch deletes and which directory each migration acts on, and each carries
  controls so a red arm cannot be mistaken for a harness that never reached the branch.

### A lesson that quotes tool output is attacker-writable (D#100 item 3, 2026-09-26)

v6.14.0's D#69 grounding shows the episode summarizer up to 12 verbatim DIAGNOSIS lines and
keeps a lesson only if it quotes one. Before it, the model saw a 60-character prefix of a
Bash call's output (`makeEntryDesc`). Tool output is written by whoever controls what a
command prints — a repo's test, a fetched page, a third-party tool — so "must quote" became
"may carry a hostile line verbatim into memory", at importance 2, the floor of the event
faces (UserPromptSubmit's event leg; SessionStart Key Events when enabled). Observation faces
are not all floored at 2: UserPromptSubmit's observation queries admit importance ≥ 1
(`scripts/user-prompt-search.js`), and an observation's importance is raised later by reads
(autoBoostIfNeeded, boostAccessed) — both found by the pre-ship reviews, not by this entry's
first draft, which said "every observation face".

Reproduced, not inferred: the shipped `handleLLMEpisode` with real Haiku (`callLLM`, CLI mode)
on a sandbox `CLAUDE_MEM_DIR`, 6 windows each carrying one hostile failing line (curl | sh,
`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`, `rm -rf ~/.claude`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `git push --force`,
one CJK line that `failureLines` never read). v6.14.0: **3 of 6** stored the directive
verbatim in the event body at importance 2. After `a3dbf2d`, 12 windows (both line orders):
5 stored it, **0** at importance ≥ 2. The probe script is not committed; the mechanism is
pinned by `tests/episode-input-filter.test.mjs` (the "quotes tool output" cases, RED on
v6.14.0).

The rule is PROVENANCE, not content: `extractDiagnosis` tags output lines (`entry.diagOut`,
always present on a Bash entry; an older Bash entry without it counts all its lines as
output), the response snippet in a tool's desc counts as output too, located by TOOL: after
" → " for Bash / Grep, after "<tool>: " for makeEntryDesc's default arm (MCP servers, Skill,
SendMessage, MultiEdit, anything unlisted). Two delta reviews found the repairs reading only
the arrow form, then reading an arrow INSIDE an MCP response first — the response is the
attacker's text, so its content must not choose where it starts, a line counts as output only if no entry authored it (a comment block an edit
added, a commit message), and a lesson sharing ANY 4 consecutive words with output (not
grounding's stricter 5-letter rule) is handled by where it lands: an event row is capped at
importance 1 with its lesson kept and searchable (no writer raises an event's importance, and
every event face floors at 2); a `change` observation loses the lesson, because observation
importance is not stable and UserPromptSubmit reads observations at ≥ 1 — and the lesson-less
row is then deleted by the lesson-less-change rule unless `CLAUDE_MEM_KEEP_LOW_SIGNAL=1`. Any
four shared words count, filler included ("is not in the"), so the cap over-reaches: a lesson
resting on the agent's own comment is demoted when it also shares such a run with an output
line in the window. That recall cost is not measured. A content filter was
not tried: a deny-list of dangerous commands is bypassed by rephrasing, and the prompt-side
`MEMORY_INPUT_GUARD` did not stop 3 of 6.
Not covered, none measured: every row's TITLE and NARRATIVE are written from the same
DIAGNOSIS block and are not checked (the SessionStart Recent table shows titles at
importance ≥ 1); a `decision` whose lesson is empty keeps its importance with the narrative
as its body; a PARAPHRASED directive shares no 4 words with the output line (the defect
review saw 1 of 6 real-Haiku windows store one at importance 2); and an agent-authored line
the same command prints back (a commit subject echoed by `git log`) counts as output, which
over-caps (10 of 991 such calls in this repo's transcripts). Two routes move a demoted lesson
back into reach, both off the default path: `activity promote --min-importance 1 --execute`
copies an importance-1 event's body into an observation's lesson (observations are read at
≥ 1), and with `CLAUDE_MEM_KEEP_LOW_SIGNAL=1` hook-optimize's re-enrich pass can write a new
lesson for the lesson-less `change` row from its title and narrative, uncapped — only when
the row's concepts, facts and search aliases are all empty too (that is the pool's
predicate; confirmed by the round-3 review's probe).

### Bash-first capture (v6.14.0): what recovering Bash file paths did to the pre-save

The N1 change (docs/audits/20260926-154904-session-history-analysis-r2.md) made Bash commands
yield their real files and made a Bash write an edit. That moved two things the commit that
shipped it did not measure; the pre-ship defect review did, and it was re-measured on the tree
that ships (after the review repairs) with `benchmark/episode-flush-replay.mjs --json` on the
base tree (`fa66e5d`) and then the release tree, back to back, 2026-09-26 18:38–18:39Z, over
every main-thread transcript on the maintainer's machine (both arms exit 0):

| arm | flushes | significant | pre-saved rows landing (upper bound) | of which dev--claude-mem-lite | reads destroyed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fa66e5d | 7700 | 4321 | 83 | 49 | 49.8% |
| release tree | 8597 (+11.6%) | 5324 (+23.2%) | 18 | 0 | 37.8% |

(The review's own reading on the pre-repair tree `207dc38` was 7658 → 8553 / 4304 → 5370 /
79 → 18 about an hour earlier; the corpus grows every session, so compare within a row pair.)

- **Why fewer pre-saves land.** The rows that stopped landing were error+test windows whose
  degraded title was the entry desc (`sed -n 895,908p tests/… → …`) because the window had no
  files. With files recovered, `buildDegradedTitle` returns `Error: <names>`, a LOW_SIGNAL
  title, and the existing write-side noise gates drop or cap it; Bash writes also turn
  `discovery` windows into `change` ones, which `isLowYieldChangeObs` drops. The policy is
  the one that was already there — more rows now reach it.
- **Who loses something.** Only the pre-save path: an install with no working LLM, and the
  one flush whose LLM call fails (hook-llm.mjs's "keep the pre-saved row" branch). On LLM
  success the worker clean-inserts a fresh row, so nothing is lost there. Decision: kept —
  the rows that stopped landing had command text for titles. Re-measure this table if an
  LLM-less install becomes a supported shape.
- **What it costs.** +23.2% significant flushes is roughly that many more `llm-episode` calls
  on the replayed corpus; +11.6% flushes because real paths now make `isRelatedToEpisode`
  split windows that used to look related.
- **What it gains.** Read paths destroyed at flush fell 49.8% → 37.8% of those consumed:
  Bash edits now make windows significant, so the reads that preceded them are kept.
- **The ruler's self-check 2 compares against a live meter written by the old code.** It
  failed on the review's run (15.1pp against a 15pp tolerance) and passed on this one;
  either way do not widen the tolerance — the meter re-baselines once the new build writes it.

## Levers measured and rejected

- **A Porter tokenizer on the FTS index — measured 2026-09-14, REJECTED.** The index is
  `unicode61` with no stemming, so `crash` does not match a row containing only `crashes`
  and `inputs` does not match `input`. Adding `tokenize='porter unicode61'` to `ensureFTS`
  is the obvious repair and it is **measured net-negative**, including on the one suite that
  exists for this exact problem.

  `benchmark/denoise-ab.mjs`, control and treatment back-to-back on the same tree, the
  treatment arm re-run once and identical to the digit (the ruler is deterministic, so the
  delta is not noise):

  | suite | control | with porter | Δ |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | precision_hard_negatives (n=30) | R@10 0.8867 · P@10 0.8108 · nDCG 0.9226 | R@10 0.8581 · P@10 0.7564 · nDCG 0.8789 | **ΔP@10 −0.054**, ΔR@10 −0.029, ΔnDCG −0.044 |
  | vocab_mismatch_paraphrase (n=12) | R@10 0.3407 · MRR 0.4161 | R@10 0.2990 · MRR 0.4834 | ΔR@10 −0.042, ΔMRR +0.067 |
  | cjk_mixed (n=15) | R@10 1.000 · P@10 0.940 | unchanged | 0.000 |

  Verdict TRADEOFF: one gain against five regressions. **That verdict counts all twelve
  metric-suite cells (4 metrics × 3 suites); the table above prints the 8 that moved**, so
  the fifth regression is in a cell the table does not show — counting the Δ column as
  published gives four. Stating it because rule 3 ("state the population") is exactly what a
  reader needs here to reconcile the two.

  **Read the resolution before the signs**: the ruler prints 1/n per suite, and only
  `precision_hard_negatives` (1/n = 0.033) resolves a Δ this size. Two of its three movements
  clear that floor — **P@10 −0.054 and nDCG −0.044**; its ΔR@10 −0.029 does not. Every vocab
  figure, the −0.042 and the +0.067 alike, is below that suite's 1/n = 0.083 and cannot be
  resolved either way. So the honest summary is not "recall traded for precision"; it is
  "precision measurably worse, recall not shown to improve at all".

  Two things to carry. **CJK is untouched by construction** — Porter is ASCII-only, and this
  project's CJK recall runs on synonym extraction, so "add stemming" would never have been a
  cross-language improvement however the English half read. And the mechanism behind the
  vocab arm failing to improve is **not established**: the plausible story is that the
  expansion machinery is built around an unstemmed index (`extractPRFTerms` deliberately
  emits surface forms, and the synonym maps are keyed on surface forms too), so stemming both
  dilutes IDF and collapses the distinctions those expansions rely on — but that is a
  hypothesis nobody has measured, and it must not be quoted as a finding.

  The user-facing gap is real and stays open. What is closed is one candidate fix. A
  query-side expansion — mapping a query term to the word forms the index actually holds —
  is untested and would need its own run of this same ruler.

- **A real shell parser (tree-sitter-bash) for the hook-path file extraction — measured
  2026-09-26, REJECTED (D#100 item 4).** Three reviews in a row found superlinear shapes in
  the hand-written parser, which is why this was worth deciding once. Measured in a scratch
  install (never added to the repo): web-tree-sitter 0.27.0 + tree-sitter-bash 0.25.1 (+
  python 0.25.0, javascript 0.25.0), Node 22, this machine, 3 runs. Import + `Parser.init`
  ≈ 8 ms, loading the bash grammar ≈ 9.5 ms, python + JS ≈ 2.6 ms — about 20 ms of setup —
  and the first parse of a real patch command ≈ 6 ms, ≈ 26 ms in all, paid by every node
  process that parses: each Bash PostToolUse, and the ≈ 52% of Bash PreToolUse calls the
  prefilter hands to node. The current parser, cold in a fresh process, takes 3.2–8.6 ms on
  the same commands (warm, its worst case over 10,389 real commands is 2.2 ms — the figure
  first quoted here, which compared warm against cold; corrected by the claims review). The
  grammar WASM files are 2.23 MB (bash 1.36 MB), 2.44 MB with the runtime, shipped to a
  plugin cache that has no `node_modules`. On the round-3 shapes at 120 KB the bash grammar
  parses the P2-3 prefilter shapes in 45–70 ms, but the python and JS grammars take
  96–663 ms and 3–511 ms on the P2-1 shapes (claims review re-measure; this entry first
  quoted only the bash figure as "120 KB in 45–70 ms"). It does not remove the reasons the
  findings recurred either: the bash prefilter (P2-3's home) runs in bash and cannot use it, and
  the python / JS write-flow resolution (P2-1's home) stays hand-written logic over any
  AST. The class is instead bounded by hard caps (`0d29930`: 4 KB bracket scans, 64 sites
  per kind, 64 KB for indirect resolution, 16 KB for the prefilter and tags), each with a
  bound test per shape. The loop-body scoping added for P3-1 costs 11 → 26 ms on 64 nested
  python loops over 62 KB. **Revisit when** a fourth superlinear finding lands INSIDE those
  caps, or when misses attributable to shell lexing (not to inline-program resolution)
  become a measurable share of the Bash edit commands that lose their written file.

- **Moving the model session summary to SessionEnd or a debounce — decided 2026-09-26,
  NOT DONE (R6 / N4).** The proposal was to stop patching Stop-side writers one by one and
  pick when, and how often, the summary is produced. Measured first, as R6 asked
  (DB snapshot 2026-09-26, every project on this machine, sessions started in the last 7
  days, `done` provenance of each session's newest summary row): 157 sessions; `done=model`
  9, `done=report` 4, `done=titles` 134, and 10 with no summary row at all (a titles row's
  `completed` is usually empty, because the session's observations were upgrade-deleted into
  events — D#95). Only 4 of the 156 hook sessions still held an observation (a fifth hit was
  a `manual-*` pseudo-session no worker runs for; first quoted as "5 of 157"), and holding
  one is the worker's gate — without it it exits before reading anything else (it also reads
  user prompts once past the gate). **So model coverage is bound by its INPUT, not its
  timing**: a SessionEnd or debounced worker meets the same gate. Where the model does win, it can be wrong — row 477, the v6.14.0
  release session, told the next session the work left was "MEMORY.md compression" while
  that session's own report listed D#101 / D#100 / N4. The writer that outranks the model by
  design, the assistant's own report, was the real gap: its header matched `Done:` only.
  Of the 1843 turn-final messages on this machine, 440 carried at least one section header
  (238 all four) and the colon form parsed 78 of those (it parsed 109 messages in all; the
  other 31 through a 中文 marker such as 剩下, some of them wrongly). Fixed in `44ad93e` (markdown
  headings, with the review repairs in `589b1e3` and after); per transcript touched in the
  last 7 days, a report Done / Not done is now readable in 86 of 106 (was 39; re-measured
  after the repairs, the 7-day window having moved). The v6.13.5/6 timing defects stay fixed and guarded.
  **Next, if anything:** after the report fix ships, count sessions whose Last Session is
  still model-sourced and label them; retiring the per-Stop model worker is the candidate
  if they read wrong. D#95 (the input) stays open.

## Condensed surfaces — original wording (pre-20 KB cap, v6.5.0)

The 2026-09-08 cap rewrote CLAUDE.md's header and its Commands / module / Rulers tables in
place rather than archiving them, so a few specifics survived only in git. Verbatim here so
the appendix stays self-sufficient — the three Baselines table rows are excluded because
their history chains are already in `baselines.md`.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
Lightweight persistent memory system for Claude Code. MCP server + hooks plugin.
- **Runtime**: Node >=22 (20 dropped in v4.0.0; EOL 2026-04 and better-sqlite3 13 requires >=22), ESM (`"type": "module"`) · npm · better-sqlite3 + FTS5
| Setup | `npm install` (needs a Node >=22 toolchain; native `better-sqlite3` binding must build) |
| Format | `npm run format` (prettier — **run it twice**, `tests/hook-update.test.mjs` needs a second pass to reach a fixed point) · `npm run format:check` — **gated** in `ci.yml` and `scripts/pre-commit.sh` since the 2026-09-05 reformat |
| Dead code | `npm run dead-code` (knip — **read the measurement contract below first**) |
| Shell | `shellcheck scripts/post-tool-use.sh scripts/pre-agent-inject.sh scripts/pre-commit.sh scripts/setup.sh` |
| **Plugin manifests** | `npm run validate:manifests` — runs `claude plugin validate --strict --json` over BOTH manifests. **`claude plugin validate . --strict` is NOT equivalent**: `.` resolves to the marketplace manifest alone, and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the one that exits 1 here. Gated in `ci.yml` (`plugin-manifests` job) against a **pinned** CLI; new upstream rules arrive only when that pin is bumped, deliberately. Carries a short allowlist of reviewed warnings — read `scripts/validate-plugin-manifests.mjs` before adding to it |
| Micro-bench | `npm run benchmark` (`node benchmark/benchmark.mjs`) · CI gate: `npm run benchmark:gate` (`benchmark/ci-gate.mjs`) |
| **Multiplier wiring** | `npm run benchmark:multipliers` · `npm run benchmark:multipliers:gate` (`--self-check`, exits 1). **Run this after touching any constant in `scoring-sql.mjs` or `MULT_EXPR` — `benchmark:gate` is structurally blind to those**, see the invariant below |
| **Recapture the gate baseline** | `node benchmark/benchmark.mjs --production-hybrid > benchmark/baseline.json` — **`benchmark/baseline.json` EXPIRES 30 days after its own `timestamp`**, and both `ci.yml` (on push) and `publish.yml` pass `--strict`, which turns that into a hard failure. Sampled **2026-09-07T08:00:55Z** (`f89520c`, recaptured at `203a426`) → red from **2026-10-07 08:00 UTC**. **The stamp lives in THREE places, not two** — `benchmark/baseline.json`'s own `timestamp`, `ci.yml:132`, and this line — and they must be changed together. `203a426` moved the first two and left this one naming the previous sample, in a commit whose own message cites R10 P3-23's "a hand-copied stamp goes stale silently"; the third surface was simply never enumerated. `tests/baseline-stamp-sync.test.mjs` now derives the expiry from `baseline.json` + the gate's own `BASELINE_STALE_AGE_DAYS` and fails if either prose surface disagrees, so this is enforced rather than remembered. In the release path the failure lands *after* the tag is pushed (v3.69.0/v3.69.1 stalled on exactly this), so recapture BEFORE tagging, in its own commit, naming the sampled tree. |
| Audit metrics | `npm run audit:metrics` · `npm run audit:baseline` |
- **`CLI_COMMANDS`** — `search recent recall get timeline browse context save update delete defer compress maintain optimize fts-check restore export import-jsonl stats citation-stats activity memdir-audit adopt unadopt help`
- **`INSTALL_COMMANDS`** — `install uninstall status doctor cleanup cleanup-hooks self-update repair rebuild-binding release`
Seven hook events are registered in `hooks/hooks.json`: `SessionStart`, `PreCompact`,
`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `Stop`, `UserPromptSubmit`. **`PreToolUse`
has THREE matchers** — `Edit|Write|NotebookEdit|Read`, `Bash` (a bash prefilter in front of the
same recall, v6.14.0) and `Agent|Task`; the `Skill` one went with the skill registry
(`docs/audits/20260906-145304.md`); `install.mjs`'s settings.json twin must stay equal to it.

Split flag in `tool-schemas.mjs`; agents reach hidden ones via the `claude-mem-lite <cmd>` CLI |
| `tfidf.mjs` | **Name is historical** — the Porter stemmer alone (`tokenize` moved to `benchmark/adoption-cosine.mjs`, its only callers). The vector engine (vocabulary, vectors, cosine, vector search, RRF merge) was removed in Phase-2; `porterStem` survives because `search-scoring.mjs` uses it on the default path, and `RRF_K` moved to `lib/rrf.mjs` |

Retrieval path: `sanitizeFtsQuery` (synonym expansion) → BM25 scoring → OR fallback →
concept co-occurrence. SessionStart emits the `<claude-mem-context>` block on stdout fresh
from the DB — CLAUDE.md is no longer auto-updated (pre-v2.30 left a stale snapshot here).
