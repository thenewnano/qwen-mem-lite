  // Measured 2026-09-22 on this machine, one fixture set for every number below (the first

  // points leak ≥12 characters (33 leak ≥13); under this order, 0. FIXED-LENGTH families are
  // the worst case, because a short read matches nothing at all rather than matching less —
  // longest head the old order still stored, minus the prefix:
  //
  //   ghp_ + 36          29 of 36 entropy chars
  //   AKIA + 16          15 of 16

  //   password= + 32      4 of 32   (the appended `…` counts toward the `{6,}` value class)
  //   sk-ant-api03- + 80  1 of 80   (the `ant` alternation lets `api03-AA` satisfy `{8,}`)
  //
  // The variable-length row is the contrast case and it is 1, not 0. The destination is not
  // a log line: this column is persisted and replayed into a later session's prompt by both
  // renderers.
  //
  // `working_on` is consequently the one column scrubbed TWICE — here, and again at the
  // persistence boundary via scrubRecord, which stays as-is because `completed` and
  // `unfinished` do NOT come from prompts: `completed` is a stored-row query (:218), and
  // `unfinished` is the in-memory episode snapshot or the on-disk task list under
  // `~/.claude/tasks/`, with observation narrative appended (:246-:289). An earlier draft of
  // this sentence said both "reach that call from STORED ROWS", which is the load-bearing
  // half of why those two columns were left alone, and it was wrong about `unfinished`.
  // scrubSecrets is a fixpoint on its own output for every family that reaches this path;
  // that property is pinned in tests/handoff-working-on-scrub-order.test.mjs rather than
  // assumed here, since D#46 is open on idempotence by CONTRACT.
  // `normalizeInline` FIRST, and it is not cosmetic. `truncate` used to run before
  // `scrubSecrets` and collapsed newlines on the way; moving the scrub earlier handed it raw
  // newlines, which flips every line-start credential noun from the scrubber's prose arm to
  // its config arm and irreversibly redacts ordinary English. That corruption is recorded at
  // secret-scrub.mjs:45-57 as one a prior pre-tag review already undone once. See
  // normalizeInline's own docblock for the measured grid. The scrubber now sees exactly the
  // one-line shape it saw before the reorder; only the LENGTH cut moved.
  //
  // Dedup keys on the SCRUBBED line, deliberately, and this is a behaviour change from the

  //
  // Exposure, measured rather than asserted: nothing renders this column and no export face
  // reads the table — `EXPORT_COLUMNS` is observations-only and `session_handoffs` has zero
  // occurrences in server.mjs and the CLI. So this is local-DB-at-rest, with no egress path.
  // A credential in a stored column is still worth removing; it is not a disclosure. (The
  // sentence this replaces claimed egress through `export` and was false — a replacement
  // justification written while retracting another one, unverified, which is this repo's
  // signature recurrence. Pre-ship claims lens.)
  //
  // Per ELEMENT, then join — never scrub the concatenation. A credential noun ending one
  // element and a `=`/`:` opening the next form a match that exists in NEITHER, and the
  // derived term set then loses a word both columns keep (measured: `zebrafish`). Same rule
  // next_steps and key_files already follow, and the same rule the truncation note below
  // states. NOT identity on ordinary prose, which an earlier draft of this comment claimed:
  // `api_key: handling` loses `handling` (5 of 6 ordinary developer prompts in a directed
  // grid lose exactly one term). What is true, and is the actual justification, is that the
  // term set now AGREES with what the resuming session is shown — `working_on` / `completed`
  // / `unfinished` lose the same word through scrubRecord below.
  //
  // SUPERSEDED 2026-09-21, and the correction is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. This
  // block used to end "No value is scrubbed twice: these elements and the columns below are

  // The chain depth is TWO, on each of the two derivations, and it is worth spelling out
