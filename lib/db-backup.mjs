// lib/db-backup.mjs — point-in-time DB snapshot before irreversible maintenance.
//
// VACUUM INTO produces a consistent, compact copy of the database (WAL-safe —
// unlike copyFileSync, which would miss un-checkpointed WAL frames). Best-effort:
// a failure logs a WARN and returns null so it NEVER blocks the maintenance it
// guards (a backup that aborts a disk-full purge would be worse than no backup).
//
// MUST be called OUTSIDE any transaction — VACUUM cannot run inside one, which is
// why the maintenance entry points snapshot before opening their db.transaction().
