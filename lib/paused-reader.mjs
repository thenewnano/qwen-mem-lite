// lib/paused-reader.mjs — read the newest `tasks/<slug>-paused.md` in a project.
//
// A paused note is the one place a session writes down BY HAND what is left and how to
// verify it; the spec governing this repo makes writing one mandatory when a session exits
// mid-task. Nothing read them. Measured 2026-09-21: 27 such files across 7 projects on this
// machine, zero readers — the handoff was reconstructing "what next" from tool history
// while the answer sat in the repo in prose.
//
// It is also why the next step is taken from a FILE rather than from a model summary:
// session_summaries.next_steps is thin, but quote BOTH numbers, because the lifetime
// average hides a trend and a single average was the original justification: 15 of 318 rows
// non-empty over the corpus lifetime (4.7%), and 4 of the newest 20 (20%). So the honest
// form is "unreliable", not "does not work" — the recent regime is four times the average.
// The reason to read a FILE instead is not the rate anyway: a paused note is written by a
// human on purpose and names its own verify command, which is a different kind of signal
// from a field an LLM fills in when it happens to.
//
// The pre-ship claims lens raised this, reporting 4 of the newest 5 non-empty; that specific
// figure did not reproduce (measured 1 of 5, 4 of 20). The caveat stood, its number did not.
//
// A leaf on purpose — `fs`/`path` only, no package imports and no edge back into the hook
// layer, so importing it costs nothing at load time (same reason lib/data-paths.mjs is a
// leaf). Every failure mode (missing dir, unreadable file, binary content, races between
// readdir and stat) yields null or fewer items, never a throw: this runs inside handoff
// construction, which must still persist a row.
import { readdirSync, readFileSync, statSync } from 'fs';
import { join, basename } from 'path';
// The one non-builtin import, and it does not cost the leaf property: format-utils' only
// edge is lib/time-constants.mjs, itself importless. Reused rather than reimplemented
// because a raw slice gets two things wrong that this function already documents — it
// leaves no mark that the text was cut, and it can split a UTF-16 surrogate pair and emit
// a lone surrogate.
import { truncate } from '../format-utils.mjs';
// Also importless — the handoff policy module. One number for "how old is too old" rather
// than a second constant that can drift away from it.
import { HANDOFF_EXPIRY_EXIT } from './handoff-constants.mjs';

// Headings whose body is REMAINING WORK, in priority order — the first one present wins,
// regardless of where it sits in the document. "Resume" is last because the generated notes
// use it for a generic instruction, which is worth something but less than an explicit list.
// Deliberately NOT matched: "Last mutation tool call(s)" and the completed sections, whose
// bullets read like work items and are the opposite of work items.

 * Default project root, with test containment on the same channel lib/resolve-data-dir.mjs

 *
 * Under vitest the default resolves to the maintainer's real repo, which carries fifteen
 * `tasks/*-paused.md` files of its own — so every suite that builds a handoff would quietly
 * write this repo's paused note into the row under test. That was measured, not imagined:
 * a probe over an unstubbed buildAndSaveHandoff came back carrying
 * `tasks/session-end-b3c0c20d-paused.md`.
 *
 * Per-file `vi.spyOn` stubs fix the same leak but are discipline, not structure — nothing
 * goes red when a new suite forgets one, which is how the sibling readers (readGitState,
 * readProjectTasks) still leak into the files that do not stub them. Neutralising the
 * DEFAULT instead makes the leak impossible while leaving an explicit `projectPath`
 * untouched, so this module's own tests still read their temp dirs.
 *
 * The var is inherited by spawned hooks too, so e2e subprocesses are contained as well.
