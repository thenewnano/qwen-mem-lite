// lib/patha-exclude-meter.mjs — the ruler D#213 named as its only blocker.
//
// D#213 (which replaced D#212, which replaced D#193) is not open because the mechanism
// is unclear. The mechanism is settled by reading: `mergeCrossHookInjected` `.map(String)`s
// the whole marker union, `hook.mjs handleUserPrompt` pushes those ids into
// `pathAInjectedIds` as they arrive, and both consumers test `new Set(excludeIds).has(r.id)`
// against a NUMBER out of SQLite — so from the first PreToolUse emission in the window the
// exclude suppresses nothing. It is open because nobody can price the repair:
//
//   "reconstructing per-prompt exclude sets needs the marker file, which rotates after
//    DEDUP_STALE_MS and is never persisted"
//
// THIS MODULE DOES NOT SOLVE THAT BY PERSISTING THE MARKER. Recording `{project, session,
// ids, ts}` at write time — the route the ledger leaned toward — buys a corpus that still
// has to be replayed later, against a database that has drifted, by a harness that has to
// re-derive which rows the search would have returned. This project has a standing rule
// about exactly that shape ("never diff two runs taken at different times"), and three
// separate rulers here carry a warning earned by breaking it.
//
// So the measurement is taken WHERE AND WHEN THE READ HAPPENS, both arms in one process
// against one database state microseconds apart:
//
//   arm A (shipped)  — the exclude as it arrives: inert against every string id.
//   arm B (repaired) — the same call with the ids coerced to numbers.
//
// **ORDER AND SIDE EFFECTS ARE PART OF THE CONTRACT, and the caller owns both.** Arm B
// must run FIRST and must run with `counterfactual: true`. `searchRelevantMemories` is
// not a read: it bumps `injection_count` on every row it returns, and that column feeds
// `noisePenaltyClause`, `demotePinned`'s `injection_count >= N AND cited_count = 0`
// predicate, and the `injection_count = 0` GC gate. The first version of this module took
// a `rerun` CALLBACK, which invited the caller to run arm B wherever was convenient — and
// the convenient place, after the delivery, is the one place it is wrong. The pre-tag
// review reproduced both halves: rows never shown to anyone reached `injection_count = 1`,
// and a prompt whose honest answer was `suppressed 0 / refilled 0` reported
// `refilled: 1, setChanged: true`, purely because arm A's own bump pushed a row across the
// >= 4 noise gate before arm B scored the corpus. CLAUDE.md already carried this rule for
// `rerank-pool-replay` — this module quoted it and then broke it. `after` is therefore an
// already-computed result, not a callback: the caller owns the ordering, this file owns
// only the arithmetic.
//
// The difference between the two delivered sets is the price of the repair, per prompt,
// with no reconstruction and no drift. `refilled` is what the pool puts back into the
// freed slots — the direction the ledger calls unknown, and the reason a suppression
// count alone would not have settled anything.
//
// `suppressed` is EXACT rather than estimated. A draft justified that with "arm A's
// exclude is inert, so arm A's result IS the unexcluded search", which is unsound: arm A's
// exclude is inert only for the ids that arrive as strings, and on a marker of plain
// numbers it works. The conclusion survives on a different argument, which is the one to
// keep: an id arm A already excluded cannot appear in `emitted`, so `numeric ∩ emittedIds`
// reports the INCREMENTAL drop, which is exactly the quantity wanted. The row carries
// `markerNumbers` beside `markerStrings` so a reader can see which regime each prompt was
// in rather than having to trust this paragraph.
//
// COST AND GATING. Arm B is a second search on the UserPromptSubmit path, so it runs only
// when QWEN_MEM_METRICS=1 AND the marker actually carried ids. With metrics off (the
// default) nothing here executes and nothing is imported at cost — the module is pure ESM
// with no dependency beyond lib/metrics.mjs.
//
// WHAT THIS RULER CANNOT SEE, stated because a face omitted silently is how the citation
// replay shipped a wrong denominator: `task_imperative` is behind
// QWEN_MEM_TASK_IMPERATIVE and default OFF, so on a stock install its arm is recorded as
// `'off'` rather than dropped from the row. And this measures the `ups` face's own
// delivery only — it says nothing about whether the reader then cited what it got.
