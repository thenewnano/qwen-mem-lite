// qwen-mem-lite: Strip <private>...</private> blocks from user-supplied text
// before any persistence or downstream processing.
//
// Use case: user wraps sensitive content (test fixtures, internal IDs, draft
// secrets that scrubSecrets misses) in <private>X</private> to opt out of
// memory capture. Replaces each well-formed pair with [redacted] to preserve
// surrounding grammar and FTS bigram boundaries.
//
// Mirrors thedotmack/claude-mem v13's <private> primitive (referenced in
// observation #8252 follow-up scope) — same syntax for cross-tool familiarity.
//
// Intentionally does NOT strip:
//   - Open-without-close (`<private>...` with no `</private>`): user may still
//     be typing; aggressive strip-to-EOL would surprise. Caller can chain a
//     length cap (`promptText.slice(0, 10000)`) after this for safety.
//   - Stray `</private>` with no opener: same reasoning, leave intact.
// Both gaps are documented for callers to layer additional guards if needed.
//
// Case-insensitive on the tag (`<PRIVATE>`, `<Private>` all work) since users
// type by hand. Non-greedy match handles multiple blocks correctly.

// Tag scanner, NOT a block matcher. The block form this replaced —
// /<private>([\s\S]*?)<\/private>/gi — is quadratic on opener-dense input: every one of
// N openers costs the engine a lazy `[\s\S]*?` walk to the end of the string looking for
// a close that is not there. Measured before the rewrite: 20k unclosed openers (180KB)
// 545ms, 28k (252KB — the PostToolUse/UserPromptSubmit stdin cap) 891ms, against 0.6ms
// for 1MB of plain text. stripPrivate is the FIRST step of every scrubSecrets() call and
// sits on the synchronous UserPromptSubmit path, so that is per-prompt latency the model
// waits on; lib/import-jsonl.mjs feeds it user files with no cap at all.
//
// "Return early when there is no close tag" does not fix it: `'</private>' + N openers`
// has a close and still costs 456ms. The alternation below has no quantifier to back off
// into, so the scan is linear in the input regardless of tag density.

 * collapses whole, as the regex did), a close with no open ahead of it stays intact, and
 * an opener with no close after it stays intact.
