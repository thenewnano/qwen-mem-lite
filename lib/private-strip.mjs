// qwen-mem-lite: Strip <private>...</private> blocks from user-supplied text
// before any persistence or downstream processing.
//
// Use case: user wraps sensitive content (test fixtures, internal IDs, draft
// secrets that scrubSecrets misses) in <private>X</private> to opt out of
// memory capture. Replaces each well-formed pair with [redacted] to preserve
// surrounding grammar and FTS bigram boundaries.
//
// Mirrors thedotmack/claude-mem v13's <private> primitive (referenced in
// observation #8252 follow-up scope) — same syntax for cross-tool familiarity.
//
// FAILS CLOSED (D13, 2026-09-29 — this used to say "Intentionally does NOT strip" an
// open-without-close, because "the user may still be typing"). Every caller strips SUBMITTED
// text — a prompt, a tool response, an import — so nothing is mid-typing, and the fail-open
// kept `<private>my secret` (no close) in the DB, the background LLM input and later
// injections, while the episode-description path already cut at an unclosed opener. Now:
//   - an opener with no close redacts to the END of the text;
//   - blocks pair by DEPTH, so `<private>a<private>b</private>c</private>` redacts whole
//     (the old leftmost-then-lazy pairing let `c` through);
//   - the tags take attributes / whitespace (`<private reason="pii">`, `</private >`);
//     `<private/>` and `<privatex>` are still not tags;
//   - a stray `</private>` with no opener stays, as before (nothing private follows it).
//
// Case-insensitive on the tag (`<PRIVATE>`, `<Private>` all work) since users
// type by hand.

// Tag scanner, NOT a block matcher. The block form this replaced —
// /<private>([\s\S]*?)<\/private>/gi — is quadratic on opener-dense input: every one of
// N openers costs the engine a lazy `[\s\S]*?` walk to the end of the string looking for
// a close that is not there. Measured before the rewrite: 20k unclosed openers (180KB)
// 545ms, 28k (252KB — the PostToolUse/UserPromptSubmit stdin cap) 891ms, against 0.6ms
// for 1MB of plain text. stripPrivate is the FIRST step of every scrubSecrets() call and
// sits on the synchronous UserPromptSubmit path, so that is per-prompt latency the model
// waits on; lib/import-jsonl.mjs feeds it user files with no cap at all.
//
// "Return early when there is no close tag" does not fix it: `'</private>' + N openers`
// has a close and still costs 456ms. The alternation below has no quantifier to back off
// into, so the scan is linear in the input regardless of tag density.
//
// The attribute run stops at `<` as well as `>`. With `[^>]*` each `<private ` that never
// closes (`'<private '.repeat(n)`) scanned to the END of the input for its `>`: 252KB took
// 2.5s (v6.21.0 pre-tag review). Stopping at the next `<` bounds each attempt by the gap to
// the next tag. The cost is that an attribute value containing `<` is not a tag.
