// face — error-recall — needed the same ramp. Two faces, one body: the project's
// "shared by two or more faces → lib/" rule, and specifically the rule that exists
// because absolute-floor logic re-typed per face is how v3.61.0 shipped a constant
// gating an IDF-bearing quantity and injected 0/8 on fresh installs.
//
// scripts/user-prompt-search.js re-exports corpusFloorScale so its own callers and
// tests (tests/ups-corpus-floor-scale.test.mjs) keep their import path.
//
// ONE DELIBERATE CHANGE ON EXTRACTION: the reference corpus is read at CALL time,
// not at module load. In production this is indistinguishable — a hook process reads
// a fixed environment — but it removes a trap for callers: a re-import with a
// cache-busting query string reloads the FACE, not this module, so a load-time
// constant here would have frozen at whatever the first import saw.

// ─── Why the ramp exists (v3.61.0 calibration history, moved with the code) ───
//
// The floors this scales are ABSOLUTE magnitudes (UPS: TOP_REL_FLOOR /
// OR_TOP_BM25_FLOOR; error-recall: ERROR_RECALL_BM25_FLOOR), but the quantity they
// gate is not scale-free: FTS5 bm25 carries an IDF term ≈ ln(N/df), so the SAME hit
// scores higher on a bigger index. Measured on one fixed query + one fixed target
// row, padding the corpus with distinct filler (2026-08-13 dogfood):
//
//   totalObs   10     40     100    300
//   top|bm25|  10.0   18.6   24.2   30.7      ← same row, same query
//
// The floors were calibrated at `projects--mem, 584 obs` (CHANGELOG v2.43.x /
// v2.34.3). Comparing a log-N quantity against that constant therefore does not
// mean "weak match" on a small index — it means "small index". A brand-new
// install measured 0/8 injections on a realistic first-day corpus (10 memories,
// 8 recall questions whose correct target ranked #1 in 4/5 scored cases): every
// one was dropped by the OR floor at |bm25| 3.8–15.2 < 30. The plugin is inert
// during exactly the window where a new user decides whether it earns its keep.
//
// Fix: scale the floors by the corpus's MAX ATTAINABLE IDF over the reference
// corpus's, capped at 1.0, so the SIGNAL↔NOISE separation the maintainer measured
// (signal ≥41, noise ≤22 at N_REF) is preserved proportionally at any N. At
// N ≥ N_REF the factor is exactly 1.0, so every established install keeps
// byte-identical behavior; only genuinely-new installs relax.
//
// 2026-08-17 e2e round — the ramp shape. The first cut used ln(N+1)/ln(N_REF+1), which has the
// right asymptotics but the wrong small-N behavior: FTS5's IDF term is
// `log((N - df + 0.5) / (df + 0.5))`, which is EXACTLY 0 at N=2/df=1 and stays far
// below ln(N+1) for the whole first-week window. Re-measured end-to-end through the
// production write path (lib/save-observation.mjs — a raw INSERT skips CJK bigram
// expansion and understates the corpus, which is how the first cut's ramp table was
// misread), 1 planted target + topically clustered filler, CJK prose prompt carrying
// no identifier for the bypass to rescue:
//
//   N              2     3     4     5     6    10    25    80
//   top|bm25|     0.0   5.1   7.0   9.5  11.4  15.5  22.2  30.3
//   ln ramp floor 5.2   6.5   7.6   8.4   9.2  11.3  15.3  20.7   ← DROP at N≤4
//   idf ramp floor 0.0  2.6   4.3   5.5   6.5   9.3  14.1  20.0   ← admits all
//
// The two ramps agree within 8% at N≥30 and within 2% at N≥200, so this re-shape is
// confined to the window it is meant to fix. Accepted tradeoff: on a ≤2-row corpus the
// scale is EXACTLY 0 (FTS5's max IDF is 0 there), which disables the set-level floors
// rather than lowering them, and just above that they are small; so the best lexical match
// is injected even when it is weak.
// That is the intended trade — the alternative measured behavior is total silence, and
// a 4-row corpus has no room to bury signal under noise. For UPS the upstream
// hasExplicitSignal gate, not these floors, is what suppresses noise prompts.
//
// N counts the WHOLE observations table, not the project: FTS5 computes IDF over
// the entire index and `o.project = ?` is a post-MATCH filter. Verified — a
// 2-row project on a 302-row install scores 31.5, matching the 300-row global
// baseline, not the 10-row one. So a new project on an established install is
// (correctly) unaffected by this ramp.

/**
 * Scale factor in [0, 1] for the absolute score floors, by total corpus size.

 * Short-circuits with a bounded probe: if a row exists at offset N_REF-1 the
 * corpus is at or above the reference and the factor is 1.0 — no COUNT scan on
 * the large corpora where the answer is always 1.0 anyway.
 *
 * Note the ceiling: this only ever RELAXES a floor on a small corpus, never
 * tightens one on a large corpus. A face calibrated at or above the reference
 * therefore keeps its measured value everywhere, and a bigger index (higher IDF,
 * higher scores) makes the same floor comparatively more permissive — the safe
