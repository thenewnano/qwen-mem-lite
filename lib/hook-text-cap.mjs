// lib/hook-text-cap.mjs — keep every string the host injects under its 10,000-character cap.
//
// Claude Code's hooks reference (code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks, fetched 2026-09-27):
//
//   "A hook's `additionalContext`, `systemMessage`, and `initialUserMessage` strings, and its
//    plain stdout, are capped at 10,000 characters … For JSON output, each field is measured
//    separately; plain stdout is measured whole. Over the limit: Claude Code saves the output
//    to a file in the session directory and replaces it with the file path and a preview of
//    up to the first 2,000 characters … Claude Code doesn't ask Claude to read the file."
//
// So an over-long injection is not cut at 10,000 — it collapses to a 2,000-character preview
// and the model is never told to fetch the rest. Trimming here, by whole lines, keeps ~9,500
// characters in context instead of 2,000, and says which ids were dropped.
//
// Two entry points, one per delivery channel:
//   • capHookText(text)        — a single string (an envelope field, PreCompact's one write);
//   • writePlainHookText(text) — plain stdout written in several chunks by one process
//                                (UserPromptSubmit), measured whole by the host, so the
//                                budget is per HANDLER, not per call.
