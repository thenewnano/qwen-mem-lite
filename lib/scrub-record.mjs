// qwen-mem-lite: per-table scrub helper. Applies scrubSecrets to the known
// text fields of a table row. Numeric / JSON-blob / id fields are passed
// through untouched.
//
// Failsafe policy: when the table is unknown, scrub every string field by
// default. Newly added tables stay safe even before TEXT_FIELDS_BY_TABLE is
// updated — over-scrubbing is the safe direction; under-scrubbing leaks.
//
// JSON-stringified array fields (e.g. session_handoffs.key_files,
// session_handoffs.match_keywords-when-array) are NOT listed here — running
// scrubSecrets over the JSON string can rewrite quoted values and break
// downstream JSON.parse. Pre-scrub each element upstream of the
// JSON.stringify call instead, via `scrubFilePaths` below.
//
// D#44: that instruction sat here for four releases and exactly ONE call site
// followed it (hook-handoff.mjs, session_handoffs.key_files). observations
// .files_modified / .files_read, observation_files.filename and events
// .file_paths all stored raw paths while the title DERIVED FROM THE SAME PATH
// was scrubbed. A prescription in a comment is not a mechanism; the helper is.
//
// Second axis, found after D#44 closed: that one compliant call site was compliant
// in SHAPE only. It mapped `scrubSecrets` over the elements — element-wise, as
// prescribed — and so read as the model the other five were measured against, while
// taking the whole-string function this module exists to keep off a path. "Follows the
// rule" and "calls the helper" are different claims, and only the second is checkable.
// Which is why the prescription above names `scrubFilePaths` rather than describing it.

  // SEGMENT-WISE, and that is the whole point rather than a micro-optimisation.
  // Many SECRET_PATTERNS carry a value class that does not exclude `/`. This is the one place
  // that number is stated, with its population, because it is GRID-DEPENDENT and five copies of
  // a bare "eight" is how it went wrong: measured here, 11 of the 40 patterns match text
  // spanning `/` on a 15-shape credential grid; the two v6.10.1 pre-ship lenses measured 12
  // (1130 path probes) and 15 (26-shape grid), and 21 on a structural reading of the value
  // classes. "Eight", carried since v6.8.2 with the enumeration
  // secret-scrub.mjs:33/74/78/83/98/109/259/260, is an UNDER-count on every one of those
  // populations — it omits at least the `Authorization:`, `AccountKey=`, `DATABASE_URL`/
  // `SUPABASE_KEY` and db-connection-URL arms. The mechanism does not depend on the count.
  // On prose the wide value class is correct; run
  // whole-path, the match eats the separator and everything after it, so
  // `/repo/token=<secret>/notes.mjs` became `/repo/token=***` — the filename
  // destroyed at WRITE time and unrecoverable, and every file under such a
  // directory collapsing onto one recall key (measured: an untouched `gamma.mjs`
  // recalled another file's observations). Splitting first bounds every pattern to
  // the segment it matched in.
  //
  // A credential whose own syntax SPANS a separator — `scheme://user:pass@host`, the Slack
  // webhook path, a `postgres://` connection string — needs its `/` characters to match at all,
  // so segment-wise scrubbing cannot see it. That was accepted here until v6.10.1 on the stated
  // reason "these columns hold filesystem paths", and the pre-ship review measured that premise
  // FALSE: `lib/save-observation.mjs` filters `params.files` on `typeof f === 'string'` and
  // nothing else, and `extractFilePaths` returns a URL verbatim from a `{path}` / `{filePath}`
  // tool input under a `PostToolUse: *` matcher. A URL reaches these columns. Measured: four URL
  // shapes v6.10.0 redacted were being stored verbatim.
  //
  // So the value decides, not the column: when it carries `://` it is scrubbed whole-string, the
  // only way those patterns match. NAMED COST, pinned in tests/secret-scrub-coverage.test.mjs: a
  // URL whose credential sits in a path SEGMENT now loses its filename to the greedy value class,
  // which is the thing segment-wise scrubbing exists to prevent, traded back on this one shape.
  // Redacting a live credential wins over preserving a filename that is not a recall key. The
  // guard is `scrubSecrets`-decided, not scheme-decided — a credential-free URL comes back
  // byte-identical, so ordinary `https://` / `s3://` / `file://` values are untouched.
