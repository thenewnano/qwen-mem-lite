// lib/episode-input-filter.mjs — what the episode summarizer is allowed to learn from (D#69).
//
// The llm-episode worker turns a window of tool calls into an `events` row with a lesson.
// A 30-row audit of this repo's events (docs/audits/20260925-200912-session-history-analysis.md
// §4.4.1) read 2 ACCURATE / 11 PARTLY / 16 WRONG / 1 GENERIC, and the failures had names:
//   1. mutation-probe vocabulary (arm names, md5/sha256 lines, mutate-then-restore steps)
//      read as product bugs;
//   2. subagent / sandbox activity (a reviewer probing an extracted tree) attributed to
//      the product;
//   3. the agent's own tool slips (a patch script's "anchor not found") turned into lessons;
//   6. lessons generalised past their evidence, with invented mechanisms.
// 1-3 are INPUT defects: the window handed to the model contained things that were never
// product behaviour. 6 is an OUTPUT defect: the model wrote a mechanism the window never
// stated. This module holds one deterministic answer to each, and nothing else — a leaf
// (no imports), so hook.mjs, hook-llm.mjs and the replay ruler all share one copy.
//
// Subagent calls (2) are not handled here: hook.mjs keeps them out of the episode buffer
// at capture time, keyed on the host's `agent_id` field, because a subagent's entries
// sharing the main thread's buffer also split the main thread's episodes — except a
// subagent call that edits a file inside the project, which is the session's work.

// ─── Per-entry tags, computed at capture time ───────────────────────────────
//
// Classification needs the FULL command and output; the episode entry only keeps a
// 50/60-char `desc`. So PostToolUse computes the tags once and the flush reads them.

/**
 * Tags for one captured tool call. Only `Bash` carries any: a probe or a patch script
 * runs through the shell, and Edit/Write failures never reach PostToolUse (the host
 * routes a failed call to PostToolUseFailure, which does not feed the buffer).
 *
 * A probe needs BOTH a vocabulary signal and a mechanism, because each alone misfires on
 * this repo's own history: the word "mutation" is in commit bodies, memory notes and docs
 * (441 main-thread calls carried it, most of them narration), and a checksum or an
 * in-place write is ordinary tooling. The strong signal is what a probe PRINTS about
 * itself ("mutation landed", "mutant"); the weak one is the word in the command, which
 * then needs a checksum, a backup copy or a restore beside it — an in-place write alone
 * is how docs get edited, and a test run alone is how a GraphQL project tests its
 * mutations. Measured precision (2026-09-26, 30 evenly spaced tagged calls
 * from this repo's history, labelled by reading each): 27/30 before the heredoc and
 * markdown-append exclusions; the three misses were a MEMORY.md append and two python
 * heredocs adding a test case whose comment named the mutation it kills.
 *
 * P2-2 re-measure (2026-09-26T17:58Z, this repo's 62 main transcripts, old rule vs this
 * one back to back): 210 main-thread calls tagged either way — 3 untagged (a test-case
 * authoring heredoc, a post-restore full-suite run, a `defer add`; none a probe) and 3
 * newly tagged (`.keep` backups, a `mutated:` line), 30/30 probes on a hand-read draw of
 * the new set. Calls dropped: 232 -> 217; the gap is the unrestored-write rule keeping 11
 * probe calls whose restore the recognizer cannot see (a `mutate()` shell function, a
 * computed path) plus the test runs after them. That is the intended direction: a kept
 * probe costs one noisy entry, a dropped fix costs the whole window.
 *
