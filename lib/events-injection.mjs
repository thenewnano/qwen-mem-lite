// lib/events-injection.mjs — surface `events` into the passive injection surfaces.
//
// HIGH-1 (full audit 2026-07-16): persistHaikuSummary upgrade-deletes every
// event-typed memory (bugfix/decision/lesson/discovery/…) out of `observations`
// and into the `events` table, so after Haiku enrichment the high-value history
// lives ONLY in events. v3.44 wired events into mem_search + PreToolUse recall,
// but the passive injection surfaces still read only observations — so the promoted
// memories were unreachable at prompt/session time.
//
// Wiring (v3.48.0): SessionStart context (hook-context.mjs, recency) + UserPromptSubmit
// path B (hook.mjs memory-context, FTS). Path A (user-prompt-search.js) is INTENTIONALLY
// not wired: both UserPromptSubmit hooks fire on every prompt and there is no cross-hook
// events dedup, so wiring path A too would double-inject the same event. Do NOT "complete"
// the wiring by adding events here to path A.
//
// id-space discipline: events share the numeric id space with observations but are a
// separate table, so injected events are rendered with an `E#` prefix. The
// citation-tracker injected-id extractors all anchor on a BARE `#`
// (FYI `/^#\d/`, memory-context `/\(#\d/`, error-recall row-anchored), so an `E#`
// row is never mis-attributed to an observation id (which would let citation decay
// mutate an unrelated observation sharing that id). Events carry no citation columns,
// so they inject as reference-only — reachability, not decay bookkeeping.
//
// D#202: that paragraph was true of the faces it names and FALSE of the one it does
// not. `scripts/pre-tool-recall.js` renders its own merged obs+event rows and used a
// bare `#` for both, so nearly half of that channel's injected rows (44.9%, measured
// over 4227 firings) were event ids entering the observation decay denominator —
// exactly the mis-attribution this prefix exists to prevent. The invariant was stated
// here while the face that broke it lived elsewhere and was not enumerated. The prefix
// is now a shared constant (lib/injected-ids.mjs, a leaf so the hot PreToolUse path
// need not pull this file's search-core chain) and
// tests/pretool-event-id-namespace.test.mjs sweeps both renderers.
