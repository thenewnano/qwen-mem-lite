// lib/hook-stdout.mjs — one hook process, at most ONE JSON document on stdout.
//
// Claude Code parses a command hook's stdout as a SINGLE JSON document. From the
// 2.1.233 bundle, the whole parser is:
//
//   function Hxi(e) {
//     let t = e.trim();
//     if (!t.startsWith("{")) return { plainText: e };   // whole stdout = prose
//     try { let r = XZf(t); ... }                        // JSON.parse(WHOLE stdout) + zod
//     catch (r) { return { plainText: e } }              // ← throw ⇒ whole stdout = prose
//   }
//
// There is no line splitting anywhere in it. That matters because this codebase
// had assumed the opposite ("Claude Code's line-based JSON parser", hook.mjs
// flushEpisode) and shipped surfaces that emit two envelopes, or an envelope
// plus a raw block, on one stdout. Both shapes make JSON.parse throw, so:
//
// There are THREE channels, not one, and each event uses a different subset. Verified
// against the 2.1.260 bundle, 2026-09-04 (minified names are rebuilt every release —
// match on shape, not on the identifier):
//
//   • UserPromptSubmit / UserPromptExpansion — plain text becomes `additionalContext`
//     and is injected verbatim, so the model receives `{"suppressOutput":true,…}` as
//     literal escaped text and suppressOutput is never honoured.
//   • SessionStart — NOT via additionalContext (see channel 1 below), but the runner's
//     status-0 branch also emits a `hook_success` attachment whose `content` is
//     `stdout.trim()`, and the attachment renderer turns that into a real message for
//     SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / UserPromptExpansion, prefixed
//     `<hookName> hook success: `. So a stray envelope still reaches the model here —
//     with a prefix rather than verbatim.
//   • PreCompact — raw stdout becomes `newCustomInstructions` for the compaction
//     summarizer (channel 2 below).
//   • everything else — plain text is dropped in silence.
//
// So contributions are queued and written once. Callers keep their own gating
// (RECEIPT_EVENTS, significance, etc.); this only owns the writing.
//
// ── THE THREE CHANNELS, and what each correction cost ────────────────────────────
//
// The original list had TWO bullets and named SessionStart as plain-text-injecting.
// The v3.94.0 rewrite fixed that half and broke the other: it moved SessionStart into
// "dropped in silence", which is false via channel 3. Caught by the v3.94.0 pre-tag
// correctness review. Both errors have the same root — reading one channel and
// generalising — which is why the channels are now enumerated rather than summarised.
//
// 1. **additionalContext.** The stdout classifier (`f8e` in 2.1.260, `Hxi` in 2.1.233)
//    turns plain text into an injectable answer for exactly two events:
//
//      if (status === 0) { let N = (plainText ?? "").trim();
//        return (event === "UserPromptSubmit" || event === "UserPromptExpansion") && N !== ""
//          ? { answer: { hookSpecificOutput: { hookEventName: event, additionalContext: N } }, … }
//          : { answer: {}, … } }
//
//    SessionStart's consumer reads `additionalContexts`, which comes off that empty
//    `answer` — so on THIS channel SessionStart really does get nothing. hook.mjs
//    SessionStart uses an envelope, so it does not depend on the finding either way.
//
// 3. **hook_success attachment.** Same status-0 branch, independent of the classifier:
//
//      if (ts.status === 0) { let ls = await bde(ts.stdout.trim(), …);
//        yield { message: cn({ type: "hook_success", …, content: ls, … }), … } }
//
//    and the renderer:
//
//      case "hook_success":
//        if (e.hookEvent !== "SessionStart" && e.hookEvent !== "UserPromptSubmit"
//            && e.hookEvent !== "UserPromptExpansion") return [];
//        if (e.content === "") return [];
//        return [Te({ content: Ra(`${e.hookName} hook success: ${e.content}`), isMeta: !0 })];
//
// 2. There is a SECOND consumption channel, and it is raw stdout. The hook runner
//    sets `result.output = status === 0 ? stdout : stderr` — the whole stdout, JSON
//    or not, quite apart from the parsed `answer`. `executePreCompactHooks` uses THAT:
//
//      let v = results.filter(r => r.succeeded && !r.blocked && r.output.trim())
//                     .map(r => r.output.trim());
//      return { newCustomInstructions: v.length ? v.join("\n\n") : undefined, … }
//
//    and `newCustomInstructions` is passed as `customInstructions` into the compaction
//    summarizer. `grep -abo '\.newCustomInstructions'` on 2.1.260 returns SIX read
//    sites; a draft said four, which is what comes of counting the ones a single
//    bounded grep happened to show. So hook-precompact.mjs writing a bare
//    `<qwen-mem-context>` block to stdout is not merely allowed — it is the ONLY
//    correct form there. Routing it through this module would deliver the literal
//    envelope JSON to the summarizer as its instructions. tests/precompact-stdout-shape
//    pins that, so the "consistency" refactor cannot happen by accident.
//
// The general rule the two corrections share: "the host drops plain text" is a claim
// about ONE channel. Before believing it for an event, find which field that event's
// runner actually reads.
