// Shared "most recent live observations" core for cmdRecent (CLI `recent`) and
// runRecent (MCP mem_recent).
//
// `recent` was the last retrieval command still hand-building its query on both
// surfaces: the live-rows filter (COALESCE(compressed_into,0)=0 AND superseded_at
// IS NULL), the optional project/type/since predicates, and the newest-first
// ORDER BY + LIMIT existed twice, kept in sync by nothing. That WHERE-clause class
// of drift has recurred three times (CHANGELOG v2.91.0 / v2.92.0 / v3.42.0), which
// is why search / timeline / recall were each extracted to a core
// (lib/search-core.mjs, lib/timeline-core.mjs, lib/recall-core.mjs). Same shape here:
// the data contract lives in this file, argument parsing and rendering stay per-surface.
//
// Columns are the SUPERSET of what the two renderers read (CLI wants `importance`,
// MCP wants `project`) — same convention as recall-core, so neither surface needs
// its own SELECT list.

const RECENT_COLS = 'id, type, title, subtitle, importance, project, created_at, created_at_epoch';

// Upper bound on rows a single `recent` call may pull, shared so the cap can't
// drift between surfaces. Pre-extraction this literal lived only in cmdRecent
// (where the positional [N] path had once skipped it entirely, letting
// `recent 999999` issue an uncapped full-table dump); mem_recent relied solely on
// its zod max(100). Clamping here means neither surface can regrow that footgun.
