// lib/injected-ids.mjs — the cross-hook injected-ids dedup marker: file name, freshness +
// same-session gate, and payload shape. Single source of truth for user-prompt-search.js
// (writer), pre-tool-recall.js (read/merge), and hook.mjs (path-A reader): all three must
// derive the same name AND agree on when a payload counts, or cross-hook dedup silently
// goes blind — it does not error, it reads a marker nobody wrote.
//
// Scope widened 2026-09-03 (audit P1-2): this module used to own only the FILE NAME while
// the gate and the write were hand-typed in five places across three files.
//
// D#120: M-6 session-keyed the marker's PAYLOAD but kept ONE file per project,
// so two concurrent CC windows full-replaced each other's marker — no dedup
// between them and `count` reset on every alternation (MAX_SESSION_INJECTIONS
// unreachable). One file per SESSION instead, mirroring
// pre-recall-cooldown-<session>.json in the same runtime dir. GC: session-start
// sweep in hook.mjs (24h mtime, same policy as the cooldown files).
//
// Lives under lib/ (not scripts/) so hook.mjs can statically import it without
// colliding with the scripts/ directory rename in installExtractedRelease —
// same constraint as lib/mem-override.mjs.

 * Read a marker file, applying the freshness + same-session gate.

 * `hook.mjs handleUserPrompt`, `readCrossHookInjected` and `mergeCrossHookInjected` in
 * scripts/pre-tool-recall.js, and both legs of scripts/user-prompt-search.js — five sites
 * spelling out the same `ts && Date.now() - ts < W && !(session && mine && session !== mine)`.
 * The lib had collapsed only the FILE NAME. Every new writer added a sixth copy, and a
 * writer/reader disagreement here does not error: it reads a marker nobody wrote.
 *
 * THE WINDOW STAYS A PARAMETER, because the callers genuinely disagree and that
 * disagreement is a live open question, not an accident to be tidied away: the two writers
 * use DEDUP_STALE_MS (5 min) and the hook.mjs reader uses 10 s. Hard-coding either one here
 * would silently decide it. Legacy payloads with no `session` keep the old
 * window-only behaviour, as before.
 *
 * IDS COME BACK EXACTLY AS WRITTEN — no Number(), no String(). The marker holds a mix of
 * raw numbers and strings and the consumers test `Set.has()` against numbers from SQLite,
 * so coercing here would turn an inert exclude live. That is D#213/D#216's decision to
 * make, on its ruler (lib/patha-exclude-meter.mjs), not a drive-by of this consolidation.

 * @param {number} opts.maxAgeMs Freshness window.
 * @returns {{ids: Array<number|string>, count: number, fresh: boolean}} `fresh:false` ⇒ ids [] and count 0.
 *
 * ONE deliberate non-identity in the consolidation, stated rather than glossed: the copies
 * disagreed at the boundary by 1 ms. pre-tool-recall used `age > W` (stale only when
 * strictly greater), hook.mjs used `age < W` (fresh only when strictly less), so a payload
 * exactly W old was fresh to one and stale to the other. This adopts the former for all
 * callers. Nothing selects on a 1 ms boundary, but "identical behaviour" would have been
 * false and the next person to diff the two would have had to rediscover why.

 *               The UPS main leg passes `candidateIds`, a MIX of raw observation numbers
 *               and `P<id>` strings, and writing those unchanged is exactly the state

 * TWO counters, and they answer different questions (R12 B-5). `count` is "how many times
 * has anything written this marker" and stays as it was. `upsCount` is "how many times has
 * the UPS face injected", and ONLY the caller that owns `MAX_SESSION_INJECTIONS` opts into

 * Edit/Read and shares this file — spent the fyi face's entire per-session budget without
 * the fyi face emitting a line. A budget has to be charged to the spender.

/**
 * Namespace prefix for an id written into the shared injected-ids marker.
 *
 * D#188. The marker file is a UNION across hooks and across tables, and the
 * convention for keeping those tables apart already existed — user-prompt-search.js
 * writes `P<id>` for user_prompts rows and `D<id>` for deferred rows, with the
 * comment "so obs ids can't collide in the shared injected-ids file". Observations
 * are the incumbent namespace and stay bare. EVENTS were the one table that never
 * got a prefix, even though the line three above pre-tool-recall.js's dedup filter
 * says in as many words that "events share the numeric id space with observations"
 * — the `src` tag added to carry exactly that distinction was not consulted by the
 * dedup predicate sitting next to it.
 *
 * The consequence, measured on the live store (3747 observations, 91.6% of observation
 * ids also existing as an event id, 2026-09-01T19:56Z): a UPS-injected observation #42
 * made event #42 unreachable to the PreToolUse face for the 5-minute window, and vice
 * versa. Replaying every real session's UPS-injected id set against the injectable
 * events of the project the SESSION ran in: **14 collisions across 11 of 60 sessions
 * (18.3%)**, 2026-09-01T20:17Z.
 *
 * WHICH PROJECT, precisely, because the draft got this wrong while arguing about
 * populations. `scripts/pre-tool-recall.js` does `const project = inferProject()` once
 * and feeds that single value to BOTH `crossHookInjectedFile(project, sessionId)` and
 * the events `SELECT ... WHERE project = ?`. So the scoping that matters is the
 * SESSION's project. The draft instead scoped by the injected observation's own
 * `project` column and reported 9 in 9 (15.5%), understating it. The pre-tag claims
 * review caught the population, having reconstructed it independently at 12 in 10.
 *
 * That is not a rounding difference, and the number that proves it is worth carrying:
 * **134 of 216 injected `ups` ids (62.0%) belong to a project OTHER than the session
 * they were injected into** (2026-09-01T20:36Z; the review measured 128/210 = 61% an
 * hour earlier). The `ups` face has a cross-project leg and it dominates, so "the
 * observation's project" and "the session's project" select genuinely different
 * populations — and only the latter is one the dedup mechanism ever asks about.
 *
 * The predicate, stated here because no harness is committed for it: seen-set per
 * session = the shipped `extractInjectedBySurface(path).ups`; injectable events =
 * `importance >= 2 AND superseded_at_epoch IS NULL AND file_paths NOT IN (NULL,'[]')`;
 * session project recovered by matching each transcript directory against the DB's own
 * project list (forward map, since flattening `/` and `_` to `-` is not invertible).
 * Dropping the project condition entirely reports 72 in 41 — a population the
 * project-filtered query can never reach.
 *
 * A SECOND consequence was claimed here before v3.86.0 was tagged and is FALSE, so it
 * is recorded rather than deleted: bare event ids do flow into hook.mjs's
 * `pathAInjectedIds`, which is handed to searchRelevantMemories and
 * rankImperativeCandidates as an OBSERVATION exclude list — but they suppress
 * NOTHING there, because `mergeCrossHookInjected` writes every id as a STRING and
 * both consumers test `new Set(excludeIds).has(r.id)` against a NUMBER out of
 * SQLite. Measured: excluding `1` returns nothing, excluding `'1'` returns the row.
 * The pre-tag correctness review found this. What it exposes is a real and separate
 * defect — that exclude list is inert for every id the marker holds as a string,
 * observations included — which is D#213 (re-filed twice from D#193, because the first
 * two versions measured the marker's WRITER instead of its reader and published 18.0%
 * for the mirror population; the corrected upper bound is 9.0%), not this one. Its ruler
 * is lib/patha-exclude-meter.mjs.
 *
 * Legacy in-flight files (bare ids that were a mix of both tables) keep their old
 * meaning for at most DEDUP_STALE_MS and then rotate; there is deliberately no
 * format version, because a 5-minute window of the PRE-EXISTING behaviour is a
 * smaller cost than a schema every reader has to branch on.
