 * citations with `{2,6}` while its OWN injected denominator used `{1,7}`, and
 * `efficacy-observational.mjs` / `adoption-replay.mjs` had a third and fourth caliber
 * (`{2,6}` / `{2,7}`). A denominator wider than its numerator counts an id as
 * injected-never-cited that the numerator structurally cannot see, which biases the
 * measured cite-rate DOWN — and nothing errors when it happens.
 *
 * Measured live impact at the time this was unified (2026-08-24, 3692 rows, ids 1..10834):
 * exactly ZERO. The only ids outside `{2,6}` are four 1-digit rows, and all four have

 * WAS anchored — every injected-side extractor in this module matches a row shape
 * (`INJECTED_ROW_RE`, `FYI_LINE_ID_RE`, `UPS_ID_RE`, `SUBAGENT_INJECT_ID_RE`).
 *
 * That argument has ONE measured exception, and it is why citationIdRe now carries a
 * lookbehind (R11-B-P2-3): `extractUserTypedIds` feeds the access allow-list through the
 * SAME numerator regex, and nothing anchors a user's own message. So a user typing `D#9`
 * and the assistant writing `D#9` intersect on an unanchored token — 8 of 43 credited
 * (session, id) pairs on the real corpus were sourced only that way, 4 of them landing on
 * live observations. Read the argument as "anchored on the injected side", not "safe".
 *
 * On the
 * denominator side nothing anchors it, so a prose `#1` is a false positive by
 * construction — it inflates "injected, never cited" and biases the measured rate DOWN.
 *
 * The v3.80.0 pre-tag review caught this concretely: pointing
 * `benchmark/adoption-replay.mjs` at `citationIdRe()` pulled `#1` and `#2` out of a
 * subagent prompt discussing fixture rows ("with `#1` superseded by `#2` …") straight into
 * `injectedIds`, on a real transcript. Excluding 1-digit ids costs nothing measurable —
 * the four 1-digit rows in the live corpus have `injection_count = 0` — and removes the
 * commonest prose collision.
 *
 * This is a stopgap for a caliber symptom, NOT a fix for the cause. The cause is that

 * production does. Do not reach for this anywhere else; anchor instead.

 * note, an audit, or a review that discusses a memory promotes that memory — including,
 * self-referentially, a note observing that the memory is about to be evicted. Nothing
 * downstream distinguishes "changed the code this lesson describes" from "mentioned the
 * lesson's number". This function supplies the discriminator the deferred item asks for
 * so the size of the contamination can be counted before anything is redesigned.
 *
 * The unit is a RESPONSE, keyed by `requestId` — one model turn, whose entries carry
 * thinking / text / tool_use blocks under a shared id. That granularity is the point:
 * a whole user-to-user exchange almost always contains some tool call, so bounding on
 * user messages would classify nearly everything as "applied" and measure nothing.
 *
 * The key falls back `requestId || message.id || uuid`. In practice `message.id` carries
 * every real Claude Code assistant entry that lacks a requestId, and it is still a
 * per-response key, so the uuid arm is close to unreachable in production and exists only
 * so a keyless entry is never merged into a shared bucket. What must NOT happen is any
 * grouping coarser than one response: one tool call anywhere in a coarser bucket would
 * mark every id in it as acted on, and the measurement would report no contamination on
 * any coding session. (The pre-tag review pointed out that the earlier version of this
 * sentence named only the uuid arm, and that the one test for it constructs a shape
 * production never emits.)
 *
 * Returns a Map keyed by id: `{ withTool, textOnly }` response counts. An id is a pure
 * MENTION when `withTool === 0`.
 *
 * NEITHER SIDE IS A BOUND, and an earlier draft of this comment claimed one. The proxy
 * errs in both directions: naming an id in a response that also calls a tool is only
 * co-occurrence, not evidence the lesson was followed (over-counts `withTool`); and an
 * agent that acts in one response and cites the lesson in a later summary response gets
 * classified pure-mention despite having applied it (over-counts `textOnly`). Use the
 * split to size the question, not to settle it.

 *
 * - `task_imperative` (v3.76 -> admitted 2026-08-25): it was excluded on a stated
 *   condition — "if the imperative framing under-performs, the penalty lands on the
 *   LESSONS it carried (imperativePick selects high-value ones) rather than on the
 *   framing" — with the instruction to read the rate first. THE RATE WAS READ AND THE
 *   CONDITION IS NOT MET. Over the live 1113-transcript corpus: 44.1% (15/34), against
 *   pretool 38.3% (521/1362), fyi 10.9%, ups 8.4%, error_recall 6.2%.
 *
 *   citation_surface_log alone would NOT have supported this — it held n=8 over 2.1 days,
 *   because the FLAG had been parked for weeks while the METER had only run since v3.76.
 *   Re-deriving the rate by walking live transcripts with the shipped extractors turned
 *   n=8 into n=34. Worth keeping as a habit: when a face's row count looks too small to
 *   decide on, check whether the meter is younger than the behaviour before concluding
 *   there is no data.
 *
 *   Two caveats travel with the number. n=34, so its CI overlaps pretool's: "does not
 *   under-perform" is established, "leads" is not. And imperativePick returns a single
 *   top-ranked lesson, so this is a top-1 pick measured against faces that inject bulk
 *   lists — a confound in this face's favour that no amount of n removes.
 *
 *   Measured blast radius, same-corpus one-pass A/B (4-face union vs 5-face union in the
 *   SAME walk — never by subtracting two counts taken at different times): 22 new
 *   (session,id) rows = +0.90% of the denominator across 17 sessions, 9 of the 22 cited
 *   (40.9%).
 *
 *   COUNT THE STREAK ON THE RIGHT UNIT. The first version of this note said "zero of them
 *   uncited across the >=3 sessions UNCITED_STREAK_THRESHOLD requires, so no demotions" —
 *   measured on marginal sessions only, which is NOT the unit applyCitationDecay uses.
 *   `uncited_streak` is per-OBSERVATION and is driven by every face at once, so the real
 *   question is whether a marginal uncited resolution lands on a row the other four faces
 *   have already walked to 2. It does: 13 of the 22 marginal pairs are uncited, and of the
 *   16 distinct observations behind them FIVE sit at uncited_streak = 2 today — four of
 *   those (#8847, #8948, #10251, #10527) are ids this flip newly resolves as uncited, i.e.
 *   one imperative-only silent session from demotion. #8847 is imp=3 with cited_count=56.
 *   The product's own CLI calls that state "Active decay queue (uncited_streak >= 2, next
 *   miss -> demote)"; a release note claiming three sessions of margin contradicted it.
 *
 *   THE RESIDUAL RISK — CLOSED 2026-08-25, in rankImperativeCandidates rather than here.
 *   All 22 marginal rows are importance=3, and the pool took `LIMIT 50` ordered by
 *   importance DESC, so in the five largest projects (projects--mem 327, code-graph-mcp
 *   121, ubuntu-sec 56, daagu 53, agentsmd 51 — counted with the pool's OWN
 *   `liveObsFilterSql`, which is the only count that means anything here) the imp=3
 *   population alone exceeded the limit: a demotion 3->2 EVICTED a lesson from this face's
 *   candidate pool rather than down-ranking it — a feedback loop the four original
 *   denominator faces do not have, because they select on FTS relevance.
 *
 *   Measuring it turned up a bigger fact than the one filed. The limit sits in SQL,
 *   BEFORE the identifier-overlap filter, so it was never a ranking bound at all: the
 *   face could only ever pick from the 50 newest `importance >= 2` rows, which made every
 *   importance=2 lesson in those five projects unreachable no matter how well it matched.
 *   Replaying 373 real prompts against their own project's corpus
 *   (`benchmark/imperative-pool-replay.mjs`), the cap destroyed 7 of 85 picks outright and
 *   changed the top-1 in 3 of 78. The bound is now IMPERATIVE_POOL_BACKSTOP = 5000,
 *   documented there as an OOM backstop and not a relevance gate.
 *
 *   The demotion half of that paragraph is now MOOT rather than merely improved:
 *   D#179/D#198 stopped this loop writing `importance` at all, so neither a 3->2 nor a
 *   2->1 walk can happen through decay and the pool gate `>= 2` is no longer something
 *   citations move a row across. The widening still matters on its own terms — it is
 *   what makes importance=2 rows reachable by this face — but the eviction risk it used
 *   to carry is gone with the writes. `subagent` shares that pool. Still open in D#172:
 *   admitting `subagent` to the denominator, which is a separate decision needing the
 *   receiver-attributed cites merged asymmetrically.

 * never enter the decay denominator by the derivation — they enter only if a
 * call site unions them in deliberately. That silence is the danger, so each is
 * named here with the reason it stays out:
 *
 * - `keyctx` (D#124): the SessionStart Key Context block re-renders the same
 *   fixed top-10 unconditionally, so an uncited render says nothing about
 *   relevance. handleStop feeds its ids in PROMOTION-ONLY — cited ones join the
 *   decay set, ignored ones never do. v3.66.0 fed them as a bare denominator
 *   and the block ate its own contents.
 * - `subagent` (D#152): the injection lands in a dispatched subagent's PROMPT
 *   and its cite signal lands in that subagent's OWN transcript, so it is not
 *   commensurable with `citedMain` — scoring it there would mark every
 *   subagent-only injection uncited by construction. Metered first (this is the
 *   whole point of D#152: the face's cite-rate is unknown), decided second.
 *   DECIDED 2026-08-25 (D#177, below): it IS in the decay loop now. It stays listed
 *   here because this constant answers "which faces leave no attachment", a fact
 *   about the transport — and that is exactly why its admission had to be wired at
 *   the call site instead of riding the DECAY_DENOMINATOR_SURFACES derivation.
 *
 *   D#164 read it (2026-08-25, 30 live sessions): 25.0% (12/48) on the house
 *   id-level caliber — above fyi (10.9%) and error_recall (6.2%), both of which
 *   ARE in the denominator, so "it performs badly" is not available as a reason
 *   to keep it out. The two costs that ARE measured: (1) admitting it means
 *   feeding its receiver-attributed cites alongside `citedMain`, which would flip
 *   3 main-face (session,id) pairs from demote to promote on a cite the main thread
 *   never made — 3 of the 1064 such pairs inside the 30 subagent-bearing sessions
 *   sampled (0.28%), or 3 of 1935 (0.16%) if you widen to every subagent-bearing
 *   session in the corpus; state which denominator you mean, the phrase "main-face
 *   ids" alone does not pin it; (2) the 33 rows it would newly add cite at 15.2% and are
 *   94% importance=3. That second cost was the LIMIT-50 eviction loop described under
 *   `task_imperative` above, shared because both faces select through
 *   rankImperativeCandidates — CLOSED 2026-08-25 by raising that pool's bound out of
 *   relevance range, so it is no longer an argument against admitting this face. Three
 *   of those 33 would still demote over that corpus, as down-ranks rather than evictions.
 *
 *   Its sibling was admitted on 2026-08-25; this one deliberately was NOT, and the
 *   difference is not the rate. task_imperative needed one line and no change to
 *   `citedMain`; this face needs the receiver-attributed cites merged in
 *   asymmetrically, and its numerator only became trustworthy on 2026-08-25 (see
 *   collectSubagentSurface — it credited cross-agent citations until then). Letting
 *   one release separate them also means the eviction loop they share is observed
 *   on one face before it acts on two. Tracked in D#172.

 *   D#177 — ADMITTED (2026-08-25, v3.83.0). The asymmetric merge lives in hook.mjs
 *   handleStop, on by default with `QWEN_MEM_SUBAGENT_DECAY=0` as the off switch:
 *   `sub.injected` widens the denominator and `sub.cited` — already the per-file
 *   intersection with what the subagent surface itself injected — widens the numerator,
 *   in the same breath. This constant stays as it is either way: it describes which
 *   faces leave no ATTACHMENT, which is a fact about the transport, not about the
 *   denominator. Admission happens at the call site precisely because it cannot ride
 *   the `DECAY_DENOMINATOR_SURFACES` derivation without the cites travelling with it.
 *
 *   Re-measured on the 1122-transcript corpus (benchmark/citation-live-replay.mjs):
 *   the face reads 25.5% (14/55). Cost of the merge, same walk: 33 marginal (session,id)
 *   pairs join the denominator at 21.2% cited; behind the uncited ones sit 21 distinct
 *   observations, FIVE at uncited_streak = 2, each one demotion away from moving.
 *
 *   FOUR of the five are 3->2 down-ranks (#8597, #8847 with cited_count 56, #8948,
 *   #10246). THE FIFTH WAS AN EVICTION and the first draft of this note said there were
 *   none: at 2026-08-25 18:00Z, #10716 sat at importance = 2, so its next miss would take
 *   it to the floor of 1 (`IMPORTANCE_FLOOR`, a constant this loop no longer has — see the
 *   correction two paragraphs down) — under the `COALESCE(importance, 1) >= 2` gate in
 *   rankImperativeCandidates, which is the candidate pool of the very face being
 *   admitted. IMPERATIVE_POOL_BACKSTOP closed the 3->2 eviction in v3.82.0 and 2->1 was
 *   always documented as still evicting; writing "down-ranks, not evictions" required
 *   assuming the marginal population was all importance = 3, which one query refutes.
 *   Count it before repeating it.
 *
 *   THAT ROW WAS NO LONGER IN THAT STATE, AND AT THE TIME THE REASON WAS THIS LOOP (D#179).
 *   #10716 read importance 3 / uncited_streak 0 / demoted_at cleared, promoted by the
 *   session that WROTE THIS PARAGRAPH: `#10716` occurs 21 times in that session's assistant
 *   text, extractCitationsFromTranscript scans assistant text for `#NN`, and at that time
 *   applyCitationDecay raised `importance` on a hit. Discussing a memory was
 *   indistinguishable from applying it.
 *
 *   CORRECTED (v3.88.0, D#179/D#198): that mechanism is gone. Neither branch of this loop
 *   writes `importance` any more, so citing a row cannot promote it HERE and the specific
 *   self-promotion described above can no longer occur. Two things still hold and are the
 *   reason the paragraph is kept rather than deleted. The general warning stands — anything
 *   in this file quoting live decay STATE is perturbed by being written down, since the
 *   loop still writes `cited_count`, `uncited_streak`, `demoted_at` and the session
 *   columns on a citation — so quote it with a timestamp and prefer the structural claim
 *   (the marginal population is not all importance = 3) to the row that demonstrated it.
 *   And a citation can still reach `importance` by a SECOND path this loop does not own:
 *   `bumpCitationAccess` credits `access_count`, and the `boost` maintain op raises
 *   `importance` by 1 above `access_count > 3` (D#206, open).
 *
 *   Cross-crediting — a main-face id the main thread never cited but a subagent did — is
 *   3 pairs. The denominator giving 0.25% is DISTINCT (session,id) across the five decay
 *   faces inside subagent-bearing sessions (1181); 0.11% is that same caliber corpus-wide
 *   (2738). The per-face sums for the same populations are 1241 and 2878 — say which one
 *   you mean, because quoting one ratio against the other denominator is the exact error
 *   this sentence exists to prevent.
 *
 * A member here that the Stop path stops feeding becomes an all-zero face, not
 * a silently-demoting one — which is the failure mode worth keeping.

 *
 * D#179 / D#198 — THIS LOOP NO LONGER WRITES `importance`, on any branch.
 * `importance` was carrying two jobs at once: a relevance prior AND a
 * pool-admission gate. Every injection surface gates on it — `>= 1` or `>= 2` on
 * the prompt faces, and hook-context's Key Context tier arms use `>= 1 / >= 2 /
 * >= 3` — so a decay-driven 3 -> 2 was not a down-rank, it removed the row from
 * the candidate POPULATION. That is the D#172 shape, confirmed on the imperative
 * pool (v3.82.0) and then on the Key Context pool, where 45 of ~106 pool rows sat
 * in the band where one demotion is an eviction (D#198).
 *
 * The ranking half of the loop is unaffected and was never the problem:
 * cited_count and uncited_streak still feed citeFactorClause, a BOUNDED
 * [0.4, 3.0] pure multiplier. So the feedback loop still responds to observed
 * agent behaviour — it just does so by re-ranking within the population instead
 * of by changing who is in it. Given that no available signal separates "acted on
 * this lesson" from "wrote about this lesson" (D#179; a release-note session
 * promotes exactly the rows it discusses, and the mention/application split
 * measured on the live corpus is not a bound in either direction), a bounded rank
 * shift is the right cost for a mis-read citation. An eviction is not.
 *
 * NOT covered by this change, and stated so nobody reads it as "citations can no
 * longer move importance": `bumpCitationAccess` credits `access_count`, and the
 * `boost` maintain op lifts `importance + 1` above `access_count > 3`. That is a
 * SECOND, independent citation -> importance path (obs #10911, D#206).
 *
 * Scope it correctly — an earlier version of this paragraph said "for any `#NN` in
 * assistant text", which has been false since v3.84.0 (f9a9eae). The credit is gated
 * on `buildCitationRelevanceSet`: the id must have been injected on one of the five
 * attachment faces, or by Key Context, or into a subagent, or typed by the user. A
 * bare mention of an id you were never shown credits nothing, and the revert switch
 * is QWEN_MEM_CITATION_RELEVANCE_GATE=off. What the gate does NOT ask is whether
 * you acted on the lesson — an injected id named only in prose is still credited —
 * which is why the path is open rather than closed.
 *
 * Measured before deciding to leave it (2026-09-02, live DB + 98 transcripts): 52
 * rows are currently boost-eligible; 25 of them are cited nowhere in the corpus, and
 * at most 3 could have crossed `access_count > 3` on citations even under an upper
 * bound that ignores the gate entirely. So the path is real and its effect is small.
 *
 * THAT BOUND IS RETRACTED (R11-B-P1-1, 2026-09-07). It was computed as "one citation
 * contributes at most 1", and that premise was false: `Stop` fires once per assistant
 * TURN and rescans the whole transcript, so before the `last_access_session_id` key one
 * citation contributed once per REMAINING TURN of its session — 338 credits over 43
 * distinct (session, id) pairs = 7.86x across 51 real transcripts, single-session worst
 * case 18.75x. The "at most 3" therefore understated its own quantity by an unmeasured
 * factor, and no replacement bound is stated here because none has been measured.
 *
 * The premise now holds going FORWARD only. Existing rows keep whatever inflated
 * `access_count` they accumulated — the true count is not recoverable from the inflated
 * one, so nothing is back-corrected. Any future reading of `access_count` as "how often
 * this was cited" must treat pre-v5.6.0 values as an upper bound, not a count.
 * It is untouched here because `access_count` has other writers (explicit recall /
 * get / timeline) and is also an input to noisePenaltyClause, so changing it is a
 * different decision with a different blast radius.
 * - per-(session, obs) idempotent via last_decided_session_id; re-running for
 *   the same session is a no-op (Stop hook may fire more than once).
 * - cross-project IDs are silently ignored by the WHERE clause.
 * - MEM_DISABLE_CITATION_DECAY=1 disables all writes; returns zeros.
 *
 * CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY ASSUMPTION (P5): a "citation" is operationally two signals,
 * neither of which is ground-truth behavioral impact:
 *   1. the literal `#NN` token appears in main-thread assistant text (citedIds), and
 *   2. (cite-back) the agent edited a file a prior lesson #NN had warned about —
 *      unioned into citedIds by the Stop handler before this call.
 * Signal 2 was added because signal 1 alone penalizes projects that act on a
