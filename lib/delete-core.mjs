/**
 * Hard-delete the given observation ids with full orchestration. The CALLER owns
 * the confirm/preview gating and fetches whatever rows it needs to render (existence
 * check, preview list, missing-id note); this performs only the irreversible mutation
 * once the caller has decided to proceed.
 *
 * Order (preserved from the pre-extraction inline paths):
 *   1. snapshotDb OUTSIDE any transaction (VACUUM INTO cannot run inside one). Best-
 *      effort: no-op on :memory:, never throws.
 *   2. In ONE transaction: strip the deleted ids out of other rows' related_ids
 *      (coarse LIKE pre-filter → JSON-parse precise filter), recover children
 *      merged/compressed INTO the doomed rows (compressed_into has no FK), then DELETE.
 *
 * @param {import('better-sqlite3').Database} db
 * @param {number[]} ids  observation ids to delete
 * @param {{ snapshotTag?: string }} [opts]
 * @returns {{ deleted: number, recoveredChildren: number, restoredSuperseded: number, snapshotPath: string|null }}
