// lib/atomic-write.mjs — crash-safe file writes with optional one-time backup.
//
// Why: several write paths mutate user-global config that, if torn or clobbered,
// breaks the user outside the plugin's control — most acutely ~/.claude.json
// (the WHOLE Claude Code config) in hook-update's post-update MCP dedup, and
// ~/.claude/settings.json in install. A plain writeFileSync can leave a
// half-written file on crash, and a fixed ".tmp" name races concurrent writers.
// This writes to a pid-unique temp then renames (atomic on POSIX), and can drop
// a one-time ".bak" so a logic bug in the caller's merge is recoverable.

  // The temp is removed on ANY failure. Without this a failed rename (target replaced by a
  // directory, permissions, a symlink whose resolution path fails) leaves
  // `<name>.tmp-<pid>` behind — and several call sites write into the USER's project root
  // (CLAUDE.md), where the residue shows up in their `git status` and nothing sweeps it:
  // the orphan sweep only walks RUNTIME_DIR. Cleaning here covers every caller rather than
  // asking each one to remember, which is the mistake the private twins made.
  // R10 P2-8: carry the target's permission bits across the rename. A temp file is created
  // with the default 0666 & ~umask, so tmp+rename silently WIDENS a private file — measured
  // 0600 -> 0644. The targets here are ~/.claude.json (0600 as Claude Code writes it,
  // holding mcpServers[*].env and OAuth account data) and ~/.claude/settings.json, both
  // rewritten on every install / uninstall / self-update prune. chmod the temp BEFORE the
  // rename, not writeFileSync's `mode` option, which is masked by umask.
