// lib/install-shape.mjs — which code homes does this machine actually RUN?
//
// qwen-mem-lite can occupy three code homes at once and they are not
// interchangeable:
//
//   plugin cache   ~/.claude/plugins/cache/<mp>/qwen-mem-lite/<ver>/
//                  runs the manifest hooks + the plugin MCP launcher
//   managed dir    ~/.qwen-mem-lite/
//                  runs the settings.json hooks + the registered MCP server
//   npm-global     <prefix>/lib/node_modules/qwen-mem-lite/
//                  runs the `qwen-mem-lite` shell command
//
// Each carries its OWN node_modules, so each has its own native binding that
// can go stale independently. install.mjs used to answer every "is the binding
// OK / are the files there" question about exactly one of them — the directory
// install.mjs itself sits in. That is the right question for install.mjs's own
// imports and the wrong one for a health check, and it failed in both
// directions in a sandbox run of the documented install flows (2026-08-17):
//
//   • plugin-only user, healthy system → `✗ server.mjs: missing`,
//     `✗ hook.mjs: missing`, `⚠ Managed files: 121 missing`, exit 1. Those
//     files only ever exist in the managed layout, which a plugin install does
//     not create.
//   • npm-global CLI + a stale ~/.qwen-mem-lite binding → `✓ better-sqlite3:
//     verified`, exit 0, while the registered MCP server FATAL'd on startup
//     ("wrong ELF class") and every hook degraded to a silent exit 0. The
//     documented repair, `rebuild-binding`, then rebuilt the healthy tree and
//     reported success. That is the v3.60 field failure (memory dead for four
//     days) with the whole diagnose→repair chain reporting green.
//
// So: enumerate the roots, probe each, and name the one that is broken.
