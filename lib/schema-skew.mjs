// lib/schema-skew.mjs — the DB is NEWER than the code trying to open it.
//
// schema.mjs's forward-incompat guard has thrown on this for a long time and the throw is
// correct: an old binary that re-applied old migrations over a newer layout would corrupt
// the store. What was missing is everything downstream of the throw.
//
// Measured 2026-09-08 on a plugin-mode machine: DB v49, live plugin cache 5.6.0 (supports
// v48). Every `openDb()` threw, `hook-shared` logged each one, and the day's
// runtime/hook-errors/*.jsonl held >=648 copies of one sentence and was still growing. The
// MCP server died before its handshake, so the host showed `-32000 Connection closed`. And
// hook.mjs's `const db = openDb(); if (!db) return;` made SessionStart return in silence.
// Nothing the user could see said "your memory is version-skewed".
//
// Two design points that are easy to get wrong, both of which this repo has paid for before:
//
//   • THE REMEDY IS SHAPE-DEPENDENT. The thrown message says
//     `npm i -g github:thenewnano/qwen-mem-lite`. That is right for a managed/npm install and inert
//     for a plugin-cache install — which is the shape that actually hits this, because the
//     cache only advances when Claude Code's marketplace updater advances it, so it lags
//     anything else that opened the DB. A repair that cannot work is worse than silence:
//     the user runs it, sees success, and stops looking.
//
//   • THREE OUTCOMES, NEVER TWO. "this home can open the DB" and "I could not determine
//     what this home supports" must never print in the same voice. The v6.2.0 round WROTE a
//     doctor check that answered "no hook command needs bash" on the one install shape where
//     they are live, because a missing file read as a zero count — and its pre-ship review
//     caught it before the tag (`f5e1786`), so it never shipped. Read that as the precedent
//     it is: the defect is easy to write and invisible to unit tests. `status: 'unknown'`
//     exists so it cannot be written here.
//
// This module is shared by hook-shared.mjs, hook.mjs, install.mjs (doctor) and
// scripts/launch.mjs, so per the project's own rule it lives in lib/ and is registered in
// BOTH source-files.mjs and package.json#files.
//
// It deliberately does NOT import better-sqlite3 at module scope: two of its consumers run
// on paths where the native binding may be the thing that is broken, and a classifier that
// cannot load is a classifier that cannot report. The only DB access here happens inside a
// child process (probeSchemaCompatInFreshProcess).
