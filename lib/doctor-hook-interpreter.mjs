/**
 * doctor's hook-interpreter check, extracted from install.mjs.
 *
 * Why it moved, since "it was long" is not one of this repo's `lib/` criteria: the
 * second criterion is a unit carved out of an entry file so COVERAGE reaches it.
 * `install.mjs` is excluded from the coverage population by name (vitest.config.mjs's
 * coverage `exclude`; the population is a denylist, so staying out costs a named entry),
 * so code living in it has no coverage reading at all — not a low one, NONE — while
 * `doctor()` alone is 1025 of
 * its ~3595 lines and holds the criteria a user is shown when their install is broken.
 * Those criteria were graded almost entirely by subprocess E2E, and the 2026-09 audit
 * found two P1s among them.
 *
 * (`vitest.config.mjs` records a spot reading of 11.67% statements from a run that
 * temporarily added the file to the population. That is a STAMP, not a current number:
 * it is dated 2026-09-03 and predates all three caliber breaks CLAUDE.md names — the
 * 2026-09-05 reformat, the vitest 5.0.0 coverage recalibration, and the 2026-09-07
 * `include` inversion. An earlier draft of this docblock quoted it as if it were
 * current, which is the carried-cell shape this repo files as a defect.)
 *
 * What is measured on THIS tree, and is the argument that actually carries: the
 * dispatch below reads 88.88% statements with its own cases, where in `install.mjs` it
 * had no reading to improve on. Joining lib/doctor-modes.mjs, lib/doctor-drift.mjs and
 * lib/doctor-benchmark.mjs, which started this split.
 *
 * A LEAF on purpose — `node:fs` and `node:child_process`, nothing from this project.
 * Doctor is the surface a BROKEN install is diagnosed from, and this repo has already
 * paid for the alternative: one import edge, taken for two path constants, put the
 * signature-verified repair out of reach on exactly the installs it existed to repair.
 * Everything else arrives as an argument.

/**
 * How many LIVE hook commands invoke `bash`, and which scripts they are.
 *
 * There are two hook registrations and only one is live per install shape, which is what
 * the first cut of doctor's interpreter check got wrong (pre-ship review P1-1). The plugin
 * shape reads `hooks/hooks.json` out of the plugin cache. The npm / npx / `git clone` shape
 * has no such file — `hooks/hooks.json` is in RELEASE_SIGNED_FILES but NOT in SOURCE_FILES,
 * so nothing deploys it to ~/.qwen-mem-lite/ — and registers its hooks in settings.json
 * instead. Reading only the manifest therefore answered "zero bash hooks" on the one shape
 * where two of them are live.
 *
 * Returns THREE outcomes, never two. `count: null` means no registration could be read, and
 * that is deliberately distinct from a count of zero: zero is an answer, null is the absence
 * of one, and a diagnostic that reports them identically tells the reader to stop looking.
 *
 * @param {{manifestPath: string, settingsCommands?: string[], installDir: string}} opts
 * @returns {{count: number|null, source: 'manifest'|'settings'|null, scripts: string[]}}
