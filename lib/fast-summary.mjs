// The non-LLM session summary — one shape, three callers.
//
// Audit 2026-08-22 P2-9. hook.mjs carried three hand-copied versions of "read this
// session's first prompt and its last few observation titles, scrub them, insert a
// session_summaries row": the Stop-time fast path, the SessionStart previous-session
// path, and the SessionStart /exit-restart fallback. They had already drifted — the
// 13-column INSERT was retyped each time, and the truncation limits split 600/600/400
// against 300/200. Copy-and-miss on exactly this kind of triplicate is what broke
// v3.35.2, and the comment in one of these blocks announcing "parity with the other"
// is the tell that parity was being maintained by hand.
//
// ONE ROW PER SESSION. Stop fires once per assistant TURN (the session file survives it
// since R10-P1-1), so every writer here runs many times against a session that already has
// a row. Each one lands on the session's newest row (`newestSummaryId`) and INSERTs only when
// there is none: Stop (`writeStopSummary`), SessionStart's /clear-or-/compact path
// (`writeClearSummary`) and hook-llm.mjs's model upgrade (`mergeModelSummary`). The
// /exit-restart fallback in hook.mjs inserts only for a session with no row at all.
// Inserting instead left one live session with 37 rows in 65 minutes, which is 9 and 10 of
// the top ten session search hits for its own vocabulary.
//
// Which writer wins a field depends on where that field came from, recorded per field at
// the head of `notes` (parseSummaryNotes): the assistant's own report beats the model's
// summary, which beats the head of the final reply (D#121), which beats the last
// observation titles.
//
// The model's write lives here too (`mergeModelSummary`): its precedence against the other
// two writers is the point of this module, and keeping the three in one place is what lets
// them agree on it.
