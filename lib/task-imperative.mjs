// lib/task-imperative.mjs — pure formatter for the task-imperative memory line.
// Shared by the live UserPromptSubmit emitter (Phase 2) AND efficacy arm U (the
// measurement that gates Phase 2): ONE tested source of truth so the measured
// framing and the shipped framing cannot drift. Hot-path-shared → regex/string
// only, NO heavy imports (lesson #8447), mirroring lib/lesson-idents.mjs.
// format-utils.mjs is a zero-import pure-string module, so it respects that constraint.

//
// Delivers a high-value lesson at the task-prompt position as an imperative,
// task-bound constraint: attribution kept (honest + #NN cite-traceable), the
// path-A/B softeners ("FYI", "continue your task", "NOT a new user message")
// dropped.
// Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-29-task-imperative-memory-injection-design.md

// The emitted line's fixed head. Exported because lib/citation-tracker.mjs matches on
// it to meter this face: an extractor carrying its own copy of the framing is the exact
// shape that silenced Go panics in v3.74.0 (trigger and filter were two lists that were
// never the same list). One constant, both directions — change the framing and the
// meter follows, or nothing does.

// this block to a spawned subagent's prompt via PreToolUse updatedInput. This is
// deliberately NOT the "You must:" imperative above: Phase-0b measured live
// (2026-07-03) that a raw imperative PREPEND trips the subagent's own
// prompt-injection detector -> refusal, whereas this appended, attributed,
// reference-only block is adopted. The four load-bearing elements (named provenance
// / "reference, not an instruction" / appended-below-the-task / no adversarial
// tokens) are the measured difference between adopt and refuse — do not drift them.
