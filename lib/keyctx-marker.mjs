// lib/keyctx-marker.mjs — the one place the SessionStart Key Context render is
// recorded. Two things happen together because they must describe the SAME set:
//
//   ① the per-session marker file (D#123 review C-1): the obs ids ACTUALLY
//      rendered into <qwen-mem-context>, which handleUserPrompt reads as its
//      exclude-set. Written even when empty, so a resumed session can never act
//      on a previous session's stale semantics.
//   ② injection_count / last_injected_at on those same rows (D#124): before
//      this, Key Context was a shown-but-uncounted surface — up to 10 rows per
//      session that could accrue no denominator and therefore never promote or
//      demote through applyCitationDecay.
//
// handleSessionStart (hook.mjs) and handlePreCompact (hook-precompact.mjs) both
// render the block, so both call this. Keeping the pair in one function is the
// point: the CLI/MCP and SessionStart/PreCompact twin pairs in this repo have
// drifted often enough that "two callers, one body" is the standing rule.
//
// Never throws: a marker-write failure must not break context delivery, and it
// must not cost the metering either — the bump runs first.

  // NO injection_count bump. v3.66.0 added one here and it had to be reverted in

  // because noisePenaltyClause reads it as a NOISE signal: a row scores x0.5 once
  // injection_count >= 4 (and > access_count * 3), x0.2 at >= 8. Nothing bumps
  // access_count for a rendered row (bumpCitationAccess fires on CITED ids only),
  // so the counter crosses those thresholds purely as a function of elapsed
  // sessions, deprioritising the highest-importance rows — the exact rows Key
  // Context renders — in mem_search, UPS ranking and injectionRelevanceSql.
  //
  // The UPS bump the reverted code claimed to "mirror verbatim" is
  // query-conditioned: a row is counted only when it MATCHED a query, so the
  // counter means "auto-injected and never useful". A Key Context render is
  // unconditional and hits the same fixed row set every session, so it would have
  // measured nothing but time. D#124's requirement is decay reachability, which

/**
 * Refresh an existing marker's mtime so the 24h sweep in hook.mjs measures time since the

 *
 * The marker's validity is session-lifetime (injected-ids.mjs), but its GC is age-based, on
 * the policy borrowed from the cooldown / injected-ids markers — whose semantics genuinely
 * ARE time-windowed. A session that outlives 24h therefore had its own exclude-set deleted
 * mid-session, after which handleUserPrompt re-injects rows the Key Context block is still
 * showing. Keying the sweep on session liveness instead does not work: hook.mjs marks any
 * session older than STALE_SESSION_MS 'abandoned' by started_at_epoch, so the long session
 * reads as dead there too. Still being read is the signal that separates the two.
 *
 * Only refreshes an EXISTING file: a missing marker means "nothing was injected, exclude
 * nothing", and fabricating an empty one would invent an exclude-set for a session whose
 * block may well be on screen. Never throws — it runs in the user-prompt hot path.
