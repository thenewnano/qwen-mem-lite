// Save-time lesson nudge (audit 2026-07-17 P4): bugfix/decision are the types whose
// value lives in the lesson (root cause + fix / constraint + tradeoff), yet they are
// exactly where lessonless writes concentrate (14d live data: bugfix 18.8% / decision
// 28.7% lessonless, worsening). The nudge fires in the SAVE RESPONSE — the one moment
// the model still has the context to write the lesson — and names the exact follow-up
// call, so acting on it costs one tool call. Zero LLM cost; the async backfill arm
// (optimizeRun wide/aliases re-enrich) stays the safety net for saves that ignore it.
//
// Shared by server.mjs (mem_save) and mem-cli.mjs (cmdSave) — one gate, two phrasings,
// no twin drift.
