 *     that has already transitioned out of 'open';
 *   * `allowStatuses: ['open', 'dropped']` (D#195) — `defer drop` on an item that was
 *     actually fixed used to be a one-way gate that permanently lost the obs link.
 *
 * The CALLER keeps its own catch: the two surfaces report a failure differently (MCP
 * re-throws with a prefix so the tool response names the contract failure, the CLI writes
 * to stderr and exits), and both need `closesTokens` to decide which message to use.
