// lib/plugin-key.mjs — the plugin's identity in Claude Code's settings, and the one
// predicate that reads it.
//
// Audit 2026-09-02 P2-7. `PLUGIN_KEY` and `isPluginExplicitlyDisabled` shipped twice in JS —
// `hook.mjs` (which exits 0 on every event when the plugin is off) and `install.mjs` (which
// reports it in `doctor`/`status` and branches on it during cleanup) — plus a third,
// deliberate copy in `scripts/post-tool-use.sh`.
//
// What makes the duplication load-bearing rather than untidy: `install.mjs` writes hooks
// DIRECTLY into `~/.claude/settings.json`, so turning the plugin off in the Claude UI does
// not remove them. They keep firing, and this predicate is the only thing that makes
// "disabled" mean disabled. A key that drifts on one side leaves the user with a plugin they
// switched off and a hook set that never noticed.
//
// ZERO LOCAL DEPENDENCIES (node:fs only): `hook.mjs` imports this at module scope on the hottest
// path in the system, and the check runs before anything else can.
//
// The shell copy in `scripts/post-tool-use.sh` STAYS a copy and is not a defect. That path
// is the ~5 ms bash pre-filter whose entire purpose is never reaching `node`, so it cannot
// import anything; its own header documents the parity requirement and
// `tests/post-tool-use-disabled.test.mjs` pins it. Two homes with a tested bridge is a
// different thing from two homes and a comment.
