 * small where it is safe and large where it is unmeasured, so nothing justifies moving
 * it into everyone's default path. Long version, because whoever reaches for this next
 * needs the numbers rather than the conclusion:
 *
 * The DISTRIBUTION suggested a floor, and then stopped suggesting it once the fixture
 * got more honest. Measured over 7 well-served cases (618 rows), |bm25_raw| by class:
 *
 *   class      n    min    p25    med    p75    max
 *   relevant   9   10.93  11.17  20.75  30.27  42.97
 *   negative   9   11.28  22.35  24.39  27.28  31.89
 *   filler    19    8.33   8.51   9.55  10.13  29.57
 *
 * 10.5 sits in that gap — filler p75 10.13, relevant min 10.93 — which is how the UPS
 * face's OR floor got its 30 in its own 22->41 gap. But adding two NO-GOOD-MATCH cases
 * (real failures the corpus cannot explain, which is the common case in production and
 * which the fixture originally lacked entirely) moves it (9 cases, 620 rows):
 *
 *   class      n    min    p25    med    p75    max
 *   relevant   9   10.93  11.18  20.77  29.99  43.00
 *   negative  11   10.59  20.87  24.41  29.25  31.91
 *   filler    30    8.16   8.89   9.56  10.99  29.25
 *
 * filler's p75 is now 10.99, ABOVE relevant's min of 10.93: the gap is gone. It was an
 * artifact of a fixture where every case had something good to find. Note too that
 * `relevant` and `negative` overlap almost entirely in both tables — per #8858 a
 * magnitude gate can remove genuinely off-topic rows and cannot tell an explaining row
 * from a merely topical one.
 *
 * The SWEEP says the achievable gain is small, because a floor only affects rows that
 * reach the injection cap and weak rows mostly do not. On the 7-case fixture a PER-ROW
 * floor at 10.5 moved 20 -> 18 injected rows, both removed rows off-topic filler,
 * relevant and hit-rate unchanged: +3.3pp precision. That was the best case for this
 * lever and it is worth 2 rows.
 *
 * The LIVE DATABASE says the cost is neither small nor measured. Pre-release review ran
 * the per-row form over 8 projects x 10 real hard-error shapes on the maintainer's own
 * DB: injected rows 221 -> 112 (-49%), and 25 of 80 firing cases (31%) went to
 * injecting nothing at all. The loss sits entirely in SMALL projects (under ~500
 * observations: -47..-87%; above ~800: -0..-3%), and corpusFloorScale cannot correct it
 * — it normalises over the WHOLE observations table, which is right for FTS5's IDF and
 * deliberately project-blind, whereas what collapses on a small project is how good the
 * best available memory is. That is v3.61.0's failure mode relocated from install scope
 * to project scope.
 *
 * The obvious repair — make the gate SET-LEVEL, matching what UPS actually does (read
 * the top row, drop the whole set on failure) so a case with one strong row keeps its
 * supporting rows — is the form implemented in selectErrorRecall. AND THE FIXTURE SAYS
 * IT IS FREE, WHICH IS ALSO WRONG. On the ruler it is a no-op at 10.5 (26 injected rows
 * at every floor from 0 to 20; it only bites at 25, costing hit-rate 85.7% -> 42.9%).
 * On the live DB, same threshold, 8 projects x 9 shapes, 69 firing cases:
 *
 *   base (off)        201 rows
 *   set-level 10.5    126 rows  (-37%)   27 of 69 cases silenced (39%)
 *   per-row   10.5     97 rows  (-52%)   26 of 69 cases silenced (38%)
 *
 * The set-level form trims fewer rows in the cases it spares, and silences just as many
 * cases. The fixture cannot see this because ITS hard negatives are constructed to score
 * high — every fixture case, including the no-good-match ones, has a top row above 10.5,
 * while real small projects frequently have nothing above it. That is the same failure
 * as the per-row measurement one level up: a fixture number standing in for a live one.
 *
 * So the per-row form buys +3.3pp on a fixture at a live cost nothing has shown to be
 * noise (citation_surface_log stores counts, not ids, so the |bm25| of the 15 cited rows
 * is unrecoverable), and the set-level form costs a third of the face for a benefit
 * measured nowhere. Neither earns a default. The defect this face actually has is that
 * command words dominate BM25 — semantic, and out of reach of any magnitude gate (D#167).
 *
 * Enable with QWEN_MEM_ERROR_RECALL_BM25_MIN=10.5 (see CALIBRATED_… above). Read at
 * call time so tests and a redirected environment both take effect.

  // a per-row floor cut injected rows 221 → 112 (−49%) across 8 projects, and the loss
  // was concentrated entirely in SMALL ones — projects under ~500 observations lost
  // 47–87%, those above ~800 lost 0–3%. corpusFloorScale cannot see that by design: it
  // normalises over the WHOLE observations table, which is correct for FTS5's IDF and
  // is documented as deliberately project-blind. But what collapses on a small project
  // is not IDF, it is how good the best available memory is. So a per-row floor also
  // shortened sets that DID have a good top row — a different and unjustified
  // behaviour from "this failure has nothing worth recalling".
  //
  // The set-level shape says exactly the intended thing and nothing more: if the best
  // match is not about the failure, stay silent (D#136's stance); otherwise inject the
  // set unchanged. Rows 2..n are never judged on their own, so a case with one strong
  // row keeps its supporting rows.
  //
  // `rows[0]` is the RANK-top row (ordered by bm25 x decay), NOT the highest |bm25|.
  // Those differ: with a 14-day half-life the multiplier reaches 2x, so a fresh weaker
  // row can outrank an older stronger one and veto a set the stronger row would have
  // admitted. Measured, this is why the set-level form silences marginally MORE cases
  // than the per-row one (27 vs 26 of 69 on the live DB). Kept as-is rather than
  // switched to max(): UPS gates on `ftsRows[0]` the same way, and one face quietly
  // disagreeing with the other about what "the top hit" means is worse than the
  // occasional veto. Stated here because the comment above used to claim otherwise.
  //
  // With the rerank above, `rows[0]` is the top row of the ERROR-FIRST result whenever
  // one exists. The gate is therefore applied to the row it is actually about — the
  // best row that mentions the failure — instead of to whatever the flat OR floated up.
  //
  // AND IT ALSO CHANGES THE SCALE, which the first version of this comment missed and
  // pre-release review caught. `(errWords) AND (allTerms)` repeats every error term, and
  // FTS5's bm25() sums over phrase instances, so a PRIMARY row's |bm25_raw| is
  // systematically larger than the same row's flat-OR score — measured on one row in an
  // in-memory index, 1.334 -> 1.779. Rows in the same result set can therefore carry two
  // different scales (primary rows error-first, fallback rows flat).
  //
  // What that costs: CALIBRATED_ERROR_RECALL_BM25_FLOOR = 10.5 was derived from the
  // PRE-RERANK distribution — the gap between filler p75 10.99 and relevant min 10.93 in
  // the table above. Re-running `benchmark/error-recall-suite.mjs --scores` with the
  // rerank ON moves filler p75 to 20.27 and relevant min to 21.87, so 10.5 no longer
  // sits in any gap. The drift is toward a LOOSER gate on sets that have a primary and
  // an unchanged one on sets that do not (empty primary keeps the flat scale), which may
  // be an improvement; nothing has measured it.
  //
  // This is documented rather than fixed because the floor's default is 0 — nothing
  // ships gated. Anyone switching it on must re-derive the constant with the rerank in
  // whatever state they intend to run, NOT reuse the table above.
