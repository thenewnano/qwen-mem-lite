// Single source of truth for the observation columns that `export` emits and `restore`
// reads back. Both the CLI (`cmdExport` in mem-cli.mjs) and the MCP `mem_export` tool
// (server.mjs) build their SELECT from this list so the two surfaces can never drift.
//
// v3.42 audit HIGH-2: the MCP export handler had its own narrower 16-column SELECT while
// the CLI export carried 24 — missing exactly the columns cmdRestore reads back
// (text / files_read / search_aliases / cited_count / uncited_streak / injection_count /
// decay_seen_count / last_accessed_at). A backup taken via MCP export then restored via CLI
// silently collapsed every empty-`narrative` row (import-jsonl / cold-start bodies live in
// `text`) to its bare title — unrecoverable AND unsearchable. Sharing one list closes that
// twin-drift class permanently.
//
// Full round-trippable set: content + value-signals (access/cited/uncited/injection/decay)
// + branch + timing. `id` + `memory_session_id` are informational: restore remaps id, and of the
// session id it keeps only whether the row was an explicit save (`manual-<project>`) or not
// (`restore-<project>`; see cmdRestore). Session-idempotency keys (last_decided/
// last_cited/last_access_session_id, demoted_at, optimized_at) are intentionally NOT
// exported — they are meaningless after a row is re-bucketed under a restore session.
// last_access_session_id (v48) joins that set for the same reason: it answers "did THIS cc
// session already credit this row", which no restored session can have done. Also intentionally NOT
// exported: `related_ids` (holds observation ids, stale/dangling after restore remaps ids)
// and `discovery_tokens` (a derived retrieval metric, rebuilt by the live system; exporting
// it would freeze a stale value into backups).
// `compressed_into` (audit 2026-08-14 M-8): only ever non-null in an export taken
// with --include-compressed / include_compressed — the default WHERE excludes those
// rows. Without the column, a compressed member round-tripped through restore as a
// LIVE row and turned up in search results next to the weekly-summary keeper that
// already absorbed it. Restore does not remap it (the keeper's id is meaningless in
// the target store); it REJECTS marked rows instead — see cmdRestore.

/**
 * Assemble the `WHERE` predicate both export faces share.
 *
 * Audit 2026-09-02 P2-5. The COLUMN set above has been shared since v3.42 (HIGH-2, when the
 * MCP handler was found carrying a narrower 16-column SELECT and silently dropping
 * text/aliases/citation-signals from the advertised backup→restore flow). The PREDICATE was
 * still typed out twice — `mem-cli.mjs cmdExport` and `server.mjs runExport` — which is the
 * half-collapsed shape that lets a `WHERE` drift while the columns stay in step, on the one
 * command whose output people restore from.
 *
 * Only the SQL is shared. Everything the two faces genuinely disagree about stays with them,
 * because each disagreement is a decision rather than an accident:
 *   - PARSING and validation: the CLI `fail()`s with a usage message on a bad date and
 *     rejects an unknown `--type`; the MCP tool throws, and its type arrives through a
 *     schema enum. Callers pass epochs, already parsed.
 *   - The LIMIT: the CLI defaults to the complete matching set (it is the documented backup
 *     half of backup/restore); MCP defaults to 200 and probes limit+1, because an MCP result
 *     is model context and a bare exploratory call must not dump a store into a transcript.
 *   - The inverted-range note, which only the CLI has a stderr channel for.
 *
 * @param {object} o
 * @param {boolean} [o.includeCompressed]  Include compressed rows. Superseded rows are
 *   excluded EITHER WAY — exporting tombstones is opt-in, exporting retractions never is.
 * @param {string|null} [o.project]        Already resolved to a canonical project name.
 * @param {string|null} [o.type]           Already validated by the caller.
 * @param {number|null} [o.fromEpoch]      Inclusive lower bound, ms.
 * @param {number|null} [o.toEpoch]        Inclusive upper bound, ms (callers push it to
 *   end-of-day themselves when the user gave a bare date).
 * @returns {{wheres: string[], params: Array<string|number>, where: string}}
 *   `wheres`/`params` for a caller that composes its own clause; `where` is the ready
 *   `WHERE …` string (never empty — the live-row predicate is always present).
