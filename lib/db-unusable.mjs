// lib/db-unusable.mjs — the database file is not a usable database.
//
// The sibling of lib/schema-skew.mjs, and it exists for the same reason: the throw is
// correct, and everything downstream of it was missing. Measured 2026-09-08 in a sandboxed
// HOME with a corrupted header:
//
//   • CLI (`search` / `recent` / `stats` / `get` / `save` / `browse` / `fts-check`) — all exit
//     1 with the SQLite message. Correct.
//   • `status` — "⚠ Database: exists but check failed". Correct.
//   • `doctor` — names the file and prints an exact repair command. Correct.
//   • Hooks — `openDb()` returns null, `hook.mjs`'s `const db = openDb(); if (!db) return;`
//     ends SessionStart with EMPTY stdout and EMPTY stderr, and every fire wrote another
//     stack trace to runtime/hook-errors/. Nothing the user sees says memory is off.
//
// State that last figure carefully, because the first draft got it wrong twice over: it said
// "20 fires → 10 identical ~1.5 KB records", which was a MIXED fire set (only some events
// reach this path) reported as if it were 20 SessionStarts, and a size nobody measured.
// Re-measured over 20 SessionStart fires: 20 records, 859-873 bytes each — one per fire, and
// ~1.7x smaller than claimed. `recordHookError` caps the stack at 6 frames and the message at
// 500 chars, so the per-record size is bounded; the unbounded quantity is the COUNT.
//
// So the one surface the user is actually looking at during a session was the only silent
// one, on a condition that never heals by itself. That is the schema-skew shape exactly, and
// this module is deliberately its mirror image so the two cannot drift apart.
//
// It imports no native binding: the static graph is 10 modules and zero package edges (the
// only bare specifiers anywhere in it are the `node:` builtins). That is the property that
// matters — a classifier the hook path may need while the binding is the broken thing must
// not sit behind a native import. It is NOT as tight as schema-skew.mjs, which imports
// `node:` builtins and nothing else; this one reaches `db-backup → utils → …` for
// `readSnapshots`. Same guarantee, larger graph — do not restate it as "same discipline".

 * losslessly; treating it as file corruption would offer `cp <old snapshot> <db>` over a
 * database whose rows are all intact.
 *
 * This lives HERE rather than in schema.mjs (which re-exports it, so every existing importer
 * is unchanged) because both consumers of the distinction now need it and schema.mjs imports
 * better-sqlite3 — a classifier the hook path may need while the binding is the broken thing

/**
 * What to do about a damaged FTS5 INDEX — the query-time half of isFtsCorruptionError.
 *
 * R10 P3-9 wired the classifier into `ensureDbWithWalRecovery`, which rebuilds and retries.
 * That covers OPEN time. A structure record damaged inside the index opens fine — nothing
 * reads it until the first MATCH — so the fault surfaces at QUERY time, and there the two
 * faces that carry it to a reader (the CLI catch-all, the MCP safeHandler) passed SQLite's
 * own sentence through with no next step. `recent` / `recall` / `browse` / `context` never
 * touch FTS and keep answering, which makes that dead end easy to misread as "search found
 * nothing" rather than "search is broken".
 *
 * ONE STRING FOR BOTH CHANNELS, unlike the file-level family below. The split there exists
 * because that remedy OVERWRITES the database and must not be handed ready-to-run to an
 * agent holding Bash. This one re-derives every index from its own content table: the rows
 * are never read from the index, so a rebuild is lossless and idempotent, and `doctor`
 * already runs it unprompted. Naming "intact" is load-bearing — the reading this line
 * exists to prevent is "my memories are corrupt".
 *
 * SCOPE, measured rather than assumed: a damaged index does not always reach the caller as
 * SQLITE_CORRUPT_VTAB. `observations_fts_data` holds three rows on a one-observation store —
 * id=1 (averages), id=10 (the STRUCTURE record) and one leaf page — and which row the damage
 * lands on decides the code. Over 100 trials each:
 *
 *   UPDATE … SET block = randomblob(32) WHERE id > 1   (structure + leaf)  98 VTAB, 2 NOMEM
 *   UPDATE … SET block = randomblob(32) WHERE id > 10  (leaf only)        100 VTAB, 0 NOMEM
 *   DELETE … WHERE id > 10                             (leaf only)        100 VTAB, 0 NOMEM
 *
 * So NOMEM comes from a mangled STRUCTURE record, where SQLite reads a corrupt varint and asks
 * for an absurd allocation — not from leaf damage. (A first draft of this paragraph said
 * "leaf pages", which would send anyone re-measuring `WHERE id > 10` to 0/N and make the
 * boundary below look vacuous. Caught by the pre-ship claims audit.) That case gets no
 * remedy, on purpose:
 * isFtsCorruptionError is what isDbCorruptionError and isDbUnusableError consult, so
 * admitting SQLITE_NOMEM would answer a real out-of-memory with a full FTS rebuild, and
 * would tell a user their index is damaged when it may be their RAM. The code cannot
 * discriminate the two, so this covers the fault it can name.
 * `tests/fts-corruption-query-time-remedy.test.mjs` pins that boundary.
