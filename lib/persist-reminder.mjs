// The write-side other half of the D#92 incident: that deferred item was
// recoverable only because the originating session VOLUNTARILY wrote a defer
// detail. When a session finalizes something in conversation (定稿/拍板/
// approved/…) and makes no deliberate persistence call, /clear loses it —
// tasks/ and docs/ are gitignored local files with no cross-session search
// face. This module detects the shape at Stop; the payload rides
// cite-recall-<project>.json and the NEXT SessionStart surfaces ONE reminder
// line (that is the moment recovery is actionable — the handoff still carries
// the context). Remind-only by design: false positives cost one line, so the
// signal list stays conservative and never auto-writes anything.
