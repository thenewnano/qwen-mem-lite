 * OMITTED from the INSERT — it never is here, because the column list is fixed. So a
 * caller passing `importance: null`, or `importance: undefined` as an OWN property (which
 * skips the OBS_DEFAULTS lookup above), wrote a NULL. better-sqlite3 binds both to SQL
 * NULL and throws on neither, so nothing upstream would have caught it.
 *
 * A NULL there is not cosmetic: the two maintenance faces disagree about what it means.
 * `maintain-core.decayAndMarkIdle` reads `COALESCE(importance,1) = 1` and queues the row
 * for purge; `search-scoring.runIdleCleanup` reads a bare `importance <= 1`, which is NULL
 * (falsy) and skips it. Aligning those two predicates was rejected — the alignment that
 * closes the gap is the one that makes the MCP face START purging — and a NOT NULL
 * migration means rebuilding a table that carries FTS5 triggers, for a population measured
 * at 0 rows. Making NULL unwritable at the two shared cores costs one function and leaves
 * both read faces exactly as they are. `doctor --session-audit` reports any row that got
