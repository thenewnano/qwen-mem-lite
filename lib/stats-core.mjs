// lib/stats-core.mjs — shared primary stats feed for CLI `stats` and MCP `mem_stats`.

// Audit 2026-07-17 MED-4: these ~15 COUNT/GROUP-BY queries were hand-copied
// byte-equivalent between server.mjs (mem_stats) and mem-cli.mjs (cmdStats) — the
// same twin-drift class the `--quality` sub-report already closed via
// lib/stats-quality.mjs, and delete orchestration via lib/delete-core.mjs. One
// computation, two renderers: callers keep their own formatting (MCP text block /
// CLI console+JSON) plus any surface-only extras (CLI hookErrors24h).

/**
 * @param {import('better-sqlite3').Database} db
 * @param {{project?: string|null, currentProject?: string|null, days?: number, now?: number}} [opts]
 *   `project` filters the whole report. `currentProject` steers ONLY the tier context —
 *   tier classification is relative to the project you are standing in, so with the wrong
 *   one the distribution collapses (measured on a fixture: {active:3, working:1} becomes
 *   {active:4}). v3.72.0 gave CLI read commands a DB-aware project but this feed still asked
 *   inferProject(), so from a subdirectory `recent` and `stats` disagreed about "current".
 *   Defaults to inferProject() because the MCP twin has no CLI-layer resolver (D#144).
