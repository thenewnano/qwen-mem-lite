// Single source of truth for resolving the QWEN_MEM_DIR data directory.
// Zero runtime deps (node:path + node:os only) so hot-path hook scripts can
// import it without pulling in better-sqlite3.
//
// The env var is a RELOCATION knob: unset → ~/.qwen-mem-lite (the common,
// non-relocated case); set → an absolute path on a larger/faster volume.
// Anything else is a mistake we must reject LOUDLY rather than turn into a
// stray directory:
//   - The literal strings "undefined"/"null" arise when a caller interpolates
//     a JS nullish value into a shell env string (e.g. `QWEN_MEM_DIR='${x}'`
//     with x === undefined). They are truthy, so `env || default` accepts them
//     and better-sqlite3 then creates a relative `undefined/` dir at cwd.
//   - A relative path silently resolves against each process's cwd, scattering
//     state across directories.
// Falsy (unset/empty) is the only non-absolute value we treat as "use default".

/**
 * Test-run containment (audit 2026-08-22 P2-4).
 *
 * vitest.config.mjs clears QWEN_MEM_DIR for every worker, which stops a relocated
 * dev DB from being read — but it cannot stop a test that never sets the var at all:
 * that test simply resolves the DEFAULT, and the default is the maintainer's real
 * `~/.qwen-mem-lite`. It is not hypothetical. During the v3.73.0 release a test
 * wrote a `rateLimited` marker into the live data dir, because the module computed
 * its path at import time and the test's later env stub arrived too late.
 *
 * The guard rides the same channel as the leak: a subprocess that inherits
 * `...process.env` (how e2e tests spawn hooks, and how the var goes missing in the
 * first place) also inherits QWEN_MEM_TEST_GUARD, so the redirect follows it there.
 * A subprocess given a curated env has to pass QWEN_MEM_DIR explicitly and is safe
 * by construction.
 *
 * It REDIRECTS rather than throws, deliberately. Throwing was tried first and took 181
 * of 289 test files down at collection: schema.mjs resolves the dir at IMPORT time, so
 * every test that imports it — including the hundreds that then use `:memory:` and never
 * touch a file — would have to opt out of a guard they never needed. "Imported the
 * module" is not the failure; "wrote to the real directory" is, and a redirect makes
 * that one impossible while leaving the import harmless.
 *
 * The redirect target is shared per run (QWEN_MEM_TEST_SANDBOX, set by
 * tests/global-setup.mjs) so a parent and the subprocess it spawns still agree on one
 * directory — the same reason the ambient env is inherited at all.
 *
 * Escape hatch: QWEN_MEM_TEST_GUARD=off, for a test that must exercise real default
 * resolution. It should be rare and it should say why.

/**
 * The runtime directory: episode buffers, per-session markers, cooldowns, hook telemetry.
 *
 * Audit 2026-09-02 P1-14. `QWEN_MEM_RUNTIME_DIR` was honoured by exactly the five
 * standalone hook scripts and `scripts/hook-launcher.mjs`, and IGNORED by `hook-shared.mjs`
 * (which `hook.mjs`, `server.mjs`, `hook-context.mjs` and `hook-episode.mjs` all take it
 * from) and by `hook-optimize.mjs`. So setting it did not relocate the runtime dir — it
 * SPLIT it: the `fyi` and `pretool` faces wrote markers to the override while `ups` and
 * `keyctx` read them from the real one. A harness pointing the system at an isolated
 * runtime got a half-isolated one, silently, with no error and no empty directory to
 * notice.
 *
 * The audit's own suggestion was to delete the variable from the five scripts. Measured
 * before copying it: it is load-bearing in ten test files, in `hook-launcher.mjs`, and in
 * `experiment/lib/arms.mjs`, which uses it to keep an experiment arm off the real state.
 * Removing it would have cost all of that to fix a split that one shared resolver fixes.
 * The defect was never that the knob exists — it is that the rule for reading it had eight
 * hand-written homes and two modules that had never heard of it.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS BEHIND THIS RESOLVER, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. The v3.93.0 pre-tag
 * review found the first cut of P1-14 half-applied — `scripts/user-prompt-search.js`
 * resolved its RUNTIME_DIR here and then built its cross-hook marker from
 * `join(DB_DIR, 'runtime')` anyway, so under the override the `fyi` face wrote the SHARED
 * marker to one directory while `pretool` wrote it to another. Four subsystems were split
 * that way (marker + skill cooldown, hook-error telemetry, the metrics sink and its GC, and
 * the native-binding breakage marker, which is the self-heal trigger). The rule that
 * resolved them, stated so the next sweep does not overshoot:
 *
 *   MOVES with the override — state a HOOK writes INTO THE RUNTIME DIR and another
 *   component reads back: cross-hook injected-ids markers, skill/pre-recall cooldowns,
 *   hook-error telemetry, the launcher's breakage/heal markers, the native-binding
 *   breakage marker, `ep-flush-*` / `pending-*` buffers, the shadow-recommendation log.
 *
 *   STAYS under the data dir, for two DIFFERENT reasons — do not collapse them:
 *     (a) state about the ONE REAL INSTALLATION — `install.lock`, `update-state.json`,
 *         `swap-in-progress`, the `.update-staging-*` / `.update-backup-*` residue scan.
 *         These must not follow a per-harness override: the lock exists to serialise
 *         concurrent installers, and two installers pointed at different override
 *         directories would each take their own lock and both proceed.
 *     (b) state that was never under `runtime/` at all — `metrics/` is a SIBLING of it
 *         (`lib/metrics.mjs` is `join(dbDir, 'metrics')`) and every caller passes the data
 *         dir. A v3.93.0 draft of this list put it in the MOVES column, which is the one
 *         error a reader following this docblock would act on: a sweep obeying it would
 *         convert `recordMetric(DB_DIR, …)` to a runtime-relative path and re-open exactly
 *         what that release closed. What was fixed there was `join(RUNTIME_DIR, '..')` —
 *         an inverse derivation of the data dir that stopped equalling `DB_DIR` the moment
 *         the override was honoured. Deriving one dir from the other is the defect; the
 *         sink itself never moved.
 *
 * `tests/runtime-dir-single-home.test.mjs` sweeps for the defect FORM (a shipped module
 * building `join(…, 'runtime')` itself) with the stays-put sites as a named allowlist, so
 * moving one out of that list is a deliberate edit rather than an omission.
 *
 * @param {string} dataDir  An already-resolved data dir (from resolveDataDir).
 * @param {NodeJS.ProcessEnv} [env]
 * @returns {string} An absolute runtime directory.
