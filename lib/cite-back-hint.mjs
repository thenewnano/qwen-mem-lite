 * token in non-assistant text, which includes tool_result bodies, file contents, CLI
 * output and pasted reports. That is the right caliber for "which ids has the model
 * SEEN", and it is not the question this nag asks. The nag asks whether the model cited
 * back the lessons the HOOKS put in front of it, and against the wide denominator that
 * ratio is structurally small: measured 2026-09-08 over all 69 transcripts on this
 * machine, wide median 0.125 vs hook-injected median 0.429, and the shipped 0.6
 * threshold fired on 46 of 48 qualifying sessions (96%).
 *
 * A gate that is 96% true carries almost no information, and because `nextCiteLowStreak`
 * only resets when the gate does NOT fire, the streak climbs to CITE_NUDGE_SILENCE_AFTER
 * within the first few sessions and the surface goes quiet for the life of the project.
 * That — not "the threshold is unsatisfiable", which was D#19's premise and is false
 * (max ratio is 0.833 today among the sessions that clear the volume floor, which is the
 * population the gate judges; over all 69 transcripts the hook-injected side reaches 1.000
 * — state which rows, the two differ) — is the defect.
 *
 * Back-compat: a payload written before this release has no `gate*` keys, so the wide
 * triple is used and the only change such a project sees is the threshold. Full revert:
 * CLAUDE_MEM_CITE_NUDGE_WIDE_DENOMINATOR=1 plus CLAUDE_MEM_CITE_NUDGE_THRESHOLD=0.6.
