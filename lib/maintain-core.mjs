 * (scripts/pre-tool-recall.js:428,470), SessionStart Key Context (hook-context.mjs:95,315)
 * and cross-project (hook-memory.mjs:280) — whereas `injection_count`, the signal that
 * triggers this op at all, is incremented ONLY on the two UserPromptSubmit faces
 * (hook-memory.mjs:367, scripts/user-prompt-search.js:979). Those are the weakest faces
 * by measured cite-rate. Dropping straight to 1 therefore convicts a row on its weakest
 * surface and evicts it from its strongest — which pre-tag review caught: on the
 * maintainer's live DB, 16 of the 17 rows this op would have moved were lesson-bearing.
 *
 *   no lesson -> 1  (fully de-ranked; the original behaviour, unchanged)
 *   lesson    -> 2  (loses the top tier and its ranking weight, keeps eligibility on
 *                    every importance>=2 face)
 *
 * The floor doubles as the WHERE bound so a row already sitting at its floor is not
 * re-touched: SQLite counts a same-value UPDATE in `changes`, which would otherwise
