// lib/hook-prune.mjs — settings.json hook-entry classification and reconciliation.
//
// Extracted here because TWO faces need it and a direct import would close a cycle:
// `install.mjs` owns hook registration, and `hook-update.mjs` (which install.mjs
// already imports) has to reconcile after a swap. Per CLAUDE.md's rule — logic two
// faces share moves to `lib/`, the big file keeps only wiring — rather than
// documenting `install.mjs -> hook-update.mjs -> install.mjs` as an allowed cycle.
//
// Zero local imports on purpose: `hook-update.mjs` reaches this from the auto-update
// path, which must stay cheap and must not drag install.mjs's dependency graph in.

 * The launcher marker (`hook-launcher.mjs`, which every Node hook routes through since
 * v2.84) replaces that clause; the product-name substring (our install-dir / legacy-direct
 * hooks) and the bash prefilters round out the real markers.

/**
 * Drop settings.json hook entries whose launcher target no longer exists.

 * Auto-update only ever handled hook ADDITIONS. `configureHooks()` strips stale mem
 * entries and rewrites every event, but its only caller is `install()`;
 * `hook-update.mjs` swaps `scripts/` wholesale, so an upgrade that REMOVES a hook
 * script leaves settings.json pointing at a file it just deleted. The launcher then
 * treats each fire as a broken install: two stderr lines and the self-heal marker,
 * for a file that is never coming back. First hit by the `PreToolUse:Skill`
 * removal (R9 review P1-1); plugin-channel installs are unaffected because
 * hooks/hooks.json is replaced wholesale.
 *
 * Narrow by construction — an entry is dropped only when it is ours (`isMemHook`),
 * routes through our launcher, and its resolved target is absent. An entry that
 * cannot be parsed, or whose target exists, is left exactly as found; a foreign
 * tool's dead hook is not ours to remove.
 *
 * Pure: returns a new settings object plus the entry tokens removed, so the caller
 * decides whether to write and can log what changed.

 * @returns {{settings: object, removed: string[]}}
