// `install.mjs` owns hook registration, and `hook-update.mjs` (which install.mjs
// already imports) has to reconcile after a swap. Per CLAUDE.md's rule — logic two
// faces share moves to `lib/`, the big file keeps only wiring — rather than
// documenting `install.mjs -> hook-update.mjs -> install.mjs` as an allowed cycle.
//
// Zero local imports on purpose: `hook-update.mjs` reaches this from the auto-update
// path, which must stay cheap and must not drag install.mjs's dependency graph in.
