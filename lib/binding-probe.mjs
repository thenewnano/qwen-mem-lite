/**
 * The one-liner a HUMAN should be given to repair the binding under `root`.
 *
 * A20260906-R8-P1-1: every user-facing "Repair:" line printed NATIVE_BINDING_REBUILD_CMD
 * alone — including doctor's, via install-shape. On better-sqlite3 13 that command prints
 * "rebuilt dependencies successfully", exits 0, and compiles nothing (re-measured
 * 2026-09-06, npm 12.0.2, both prebuild states), so the copy-paste repair REPORTS SUCCESS
 * on a still-dead binding. That is worse than printing nothing. The command that heals was
 * added in v4.0.0 but lived only inside the automated chain and was shown to nobody.
 *
 * This is the same defect the CHANGELOG records once already: the hints used to say
 * `--build-from-source`, which no-oped the same way, and were changed to the flag above.
 * That fix was right for better-sqlite3 12 and expired when the dependency was bumped.
 *
 * `&&`, never `||`: step 1 exits 0 whether or not it did anything, so an `||` chain would
 * never reach step 2 — the no-op is the whole trap. Sequencing unconditionally costs a
 * recompile in the case step 1 already fixed, which is the right trade for a manual repair.
 * Precisely: `build-release` is `node-gyp clean && node-gyp rebuild`, so step 2 DISCARDS a
 * binding step 1 had just produced and rebuilds it. `prebuilds/` is untouched either way, so
 * the end state is a usable binding; the cost is time, not correctness.
