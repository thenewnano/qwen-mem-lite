// lib/hook-stdin.mjs — one bounded stdin reader for every hook entry point.
//
// Audit 2026-09-02 P1-9. Six hook processes read the host's JSON payload off stdin and they
// did it six ways, in two groups:
//
//   BOUNDED, three different calibers: hook.mjs (3 s / 256 KB / `{text, truncated}`),
//   scripts/user-prompt-search.js (2 s / 64 KB / bare string), scripts/pre-agent-inject.js
//   (1.5 s / 262144 / never rejects).
//
//   UNBOUNDED, three copies of `for await (const chunk of process.stdin) input += chunk`:
//   pre-tool-recall.js, post-tool-recall.js. No cap and no timeout.
//   That matters most on `PreToolUse:Write`, whose `tool_input.content` is the ENTIRE file
//   being written: writing a multi-megabyte file made pre-tool-recall buffer all of it and
//   `JSON.parse` all of it, to read `file_path`. The only bound was the host's own 3 s
//   fail-open — i.e. the hook silently did nothing, which is indistinguishable from the
//   hook having nothing to say.
//
// ZERO DEPENDENCIES, deliberately: the importers are latency-sensitive hook processes whose
// whole cost is module loading, and one of them (`pre-agent-inject.js`) exists to be the
// cheap default-off path. Nothing here imports from the repo.
//
// The calibers are NOT unified. Each caller passes its own, because those numbers are
// decisions about different payloads — a user prompt is not a tool response — and quietly
// giving one caller another's limits is a behaviour change wearing a refactor's clothes.
// What is shared is the mechanism: cap, timer, teardown, and the guarantee that the promise
// settles exactly once.

 * each call site because two entry points see that same payload class, and two hand-written
 * numbers for one class is the drift shape this module exists to remove — this is NOT the
 * calibers being unified, which the note above rules out: a caller with a different payload
 * class still passes its own.
 *
 * Sized as a MEMORY backstop, not a functional gate. The v3.93.0 pre-tag review measured the
 * 256 KB default silently dropping `pretool` recall for any Write over that size, on the
 * reasoning that a truncated payload matched what the host's 3 s fail-open already did —
 * `JSON.parse` is 2.99 ms at 5 MB and 10.8 ms at 10 MB, so it did not.

 * prefix does not carry a `file_path` — the caller then behaves exactly as it did before
 * salvage existed, so this can only add recalls, never remove one.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in the one script that calls it because it is about a payload this
 * module bounded: the cap and the recovery from the cap are one decision, and a helper that
 * only the truncating module's caller can reach is a helper nothing can unit-test.
 *
 * Deliberately regex over the prefix rather than a streaming parser: the fields are flat
 * string scalars, and a partial-JSON parser is a dependency and a failure mode for a path
 * whose entire budget is the host's fail-open window.
