// lib/cli-project.mjs — which project a terminal-invoked CLI command should read.
//
// `inferProject()` names the directory the process stands in (CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR || PWD ||
// cwd). Inside a hook that is always the session root, because Claude Code sets
// CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR. In a bare terminal it is not set, so the name follows the user:
// `cd src/auth && qwen-mem-lite recent` asks for `src--auth`, which holds nothing, while
// the session's hooks have been writing `projects--mem`. The command answers "No recent
// observations" about a project full of them.
//
// Anchoring on the git work-tree root instead was tried and reverted before shipping (see
// project-utils.mjs): Claude Code started in `mono/packages/api` sets CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR to
// the PACKAGE dir, so hooks write `packages--api` while a git anchor sends the CLI to
// `mono--monorepo` — the same split, mirrored. No purely path-derived rule separates the two
// cases, because the difference is which name the hooks actually chose. The DB knows.
//
// So: compute both candidates, prefer whichever already holds rows, cwd winning ties.
//
// READ COMMANDS ONLY. The tie rule ("can only redirect when the cwd-derived name holds
// NOTHING") reads like a universal safety argument, and pre-tag review reproduced why it is
// not: for a read, "cwd holds nothing" means there is nothing to lose; for a WRITE it is the
// normal precondition of a project about to be born. Applying the fallback to save /
// defer add / restore / import-jsonl absorbed a fresh package dir's first rows into the
// enclosing repo, and once the session's hooks later wrote `packages--api`, those rows were
// unreachable from the directory they were written in. Write paths keep plain
// inferProject(); callers in mem-cli.mjs and cli/activity.mjs mark which is which.
//
// Lives here, not in project-utils.mjs: that module is DB-free and on the hook hot path, and
// hook-side resolution must stay byte-identical (hooks already have the right answer).
