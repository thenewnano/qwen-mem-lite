// Shared "compress old low-value observations into weekly summaries" core.
//
// Single source of truth for cmdCompress (CLI), mem_compress (MCP), and
// handleAutoCompress (hook). Pre-extraction the candidate query, the
// project+ISO-week grouping, and the per-group summary INSERT + mark-compressed
// were copy-pasted across all three and kept in sync by hand-written "parity"
// comments — which is exactly how the TF-IDF-vector write drifted out of the
// compression path (audit ARCH-1). Call sites keep what legitimately differs:
// argument parsing, preview rendering, candidate-window params, and transaction
// granularity (CLI/MCP wrap all groups in one transaction; the hook transacts
// each group). They no longer re-implement the mutation.
//
// The summary INSERT used to also write a TF-IDF observation_vectors row in the same
// (caller-owned) transaction, so that FTS-miss queries falling back to vector recall could
// still reach compressed summaries (audit P6). Phase-2 removed the vector arm, so both the
// write and the recall path it served are gone; the summary is reachable by FTS alone.
