// lib/shard-gc.mjs — retention sweep for daily JSONL shard directories.
//
// `lib/metrics.mjs` (QWEN_MEM_METRICS) appends one `YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` per day with
// no GC of its own, so a long-lived install grows that dir unbounded.
//
// This module exists because there used to be TWO such sinks — the second was
// `registry-recommend.mjs`'s shadow log — and the sweep was written twice, line for
// line, differing only in how the directory is resolved; audit 2026-09-05 P2-3 found
// it as the largest non-intentional cross-file duplicate. That is the twin-drift class
// CLAUDE.md names: the retention rule (90 days, the `YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` name filter) had
// two homes and could disagree with itself. The skill-registry subsystem was removed in
// 2026-09 (docs/audits/20260906-145304.md), leaving one caller; the extraction stays
// because the retention rule is worth owning in one place, not because of the caller count.
//
// Directory resolution stays with each caller — it is the only part that differed.
