// 7 days outlived its owning session by an order of magnitude. The margin over 12 h is
// deliberate slack for a laptop suspended across a long weekend, not a second threshold with
// its own meaning. Considered and rejected: flushing on sweep instead of deleting — it would
// re-date the content exactly the way the revisit path does, i.e. commit the defect on
// purpose rather than by omission.
