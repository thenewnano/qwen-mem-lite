      //     is the design, not a defect. `doctor()` shadows the file-level helpers on
      //     purpose so every existing call site captures into `checks` instead of
      //     printing; that IS how `--json` works, and the code says so two lines above.
      //     The rule would force a disable comment on a documented mechanism or ~40
      //     renames to undo it.
      //   server.mjs ×6         a handler parameter named `db` over the module-level
      //     `db`. Idiomatic, scoped, and the rename makes every call site read worse.
      //   install.mjs ×3        `cmd`, same shape.

      // hook.mjs handleUserPrompt for a file's contents) was renamed by hand instead.

    // backup. The warning above still applies to every OTHER entry in this list: adding a
    // directory here decides its code may rot unchecked. This one has no code to rot —
    // nothing imports it and nothing ships it (audit 2026-09-02 P2-1; D#168 closed the
    // same hole for `tmp/`).
    // `.claude/**` holds `isolation: "worktree"` agent checkouts — whole copies of the repo
    // mid-edit (vitest.config.mjs excludes them for the same reason). Nothing under it is tracked.
