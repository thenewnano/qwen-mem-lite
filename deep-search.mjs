// claude-mem-lite: Opt-in LLM multi-query / HyDE deep search.
//
// This is the EXPLICIT "search harder" path — it is NOT on the passive hook
// pipeline, which stays sub-millisecond single-query (see feedback_passive_first
// / reference_everos_comparison). One LLM call rewrites the query into a few
// variants (concrete keyword form, concept expansion, and a HyDE hypothetical),
// each variant runs the real searchObservationsHybrid, and the N ranked lists
// are Reciprocal-Rank-Fusion merged. On the vocabulary-mismatch fixture the PoC
// measured R@10 0.33 -> 0.62 (#8731) where TF-IDF/FTS5 alone fail, because HyDE
// maps a user's concept words ("container orchestration") onto the tech terms
// the memory actually uses ("Kubernetes pods").
//
// Reliability is by CONSTRUCTION, because the PoC's weak point was rewrite
// reliability (5/12 Haiku rewrites came back empty, and #8605 proved tightening
// the prompt does NOT fix Haiku's JSON compliance):
//   1. The ORIGINAL query is ALWAYS variant[0]. If the rewrite returns nothing
//      usable, the variant set collapses to [original] and RRF over a single
//      list preserves that list's order — deepSearch then equals the
//      single-query baseline EXACTLY. That is the hard floor: a failed rewrite
//      is never worse than baseline. (With successful rewrites, RRF maximizes
//      AGGREGATE recall but is not per-query monotonic — it can displace one
//      query's marginal hit from the top-K; measured net is strongly positive,
//      benchmark R@10 0.33 -> 0.87 on the all-rewrites-usable ceiling.)
//   2. rewriteQuery parses defensively (parseJsonFromLLM, inside callModelJSON,
//      already strips Haiku's ```json fences) and retries ONCE on an empty /
//      unparseable response before falling back. The lever is structure +
//      fallback, not prompt verbiage.
//
// The LLM and the per-variant search function are dependency-injected so the
// logic is unit-testable without a provider, and so this module never has to
// statically import the native-heavy LLM client at module load (the default
// provider is pulled in lazily on first real call).

 * large enough that deep search could plausibly find more (see corpus guard
 * below).
 *
 * NOTE: ctx.orFallbackFired was intentionally removed as an escalation trigger.
 * orFallbackFired fires on SUCCESSFUL AND→OR recovery — when the fallback
 * returns enough results it is a sign the query is working, not that it is
 * weak. Escalating on a successful recovery (a) discards good results already
 * in hand, (b) fires an unwanted LLM call, and (c) erases the AND→OR hint
 * that surfaces to the caller. The genuinely-weak vocab-mismatch case (AND
 * fails, OR also fails) is still caught: if OR recovers nothing, count is 0-2
 * → escalates on count alone.
 *
 * Corpus guard (folded in): the count-based trigger above is correct for a real
 * corpus, but on a near-empty / brand-new / benchmark project EVERY 0-hit query
 * looks "weak", so a caller that only checks the count would auto-escalate (and
 * fire a Haiku rewrite) on a store HyDE/multi-query can't possibly rescue — the
 * "[mem] auto-escalated … 0 hits" spam. hasEscalatableCorpus used to be a
 * SEPARATE function each caller had to remember to AND in; folding it in here
 * means passing `db` self-suppresses escalation when the corpus is too small,

 * One-line disclosure for a deep result set, written to the channel the CALLER reads.
 *
 * D#3. benchmark/deep-search-holdout.mjs asks the suite's own queries of a corpus with
 * their relevant_ids deleted, so the correct answer is zero rows and every returned row is
 * a false positive by construction. It reads mean FP@10 = 10.00 across 12/12 queries: deep
 * fills every slot, every time. THE FLOOD IS NOT THE PARAPHRASE UNION, and an earlier
 * version of this paragraph said it was ("the single-query baseline returns 1-2 rows on the
 * same negatives"). Measured 2026-09-07, same fixture: the single-variant baseline already
 * returns mean 9.42 of 10 (min 5, max 10, n=12), so fusion adds about half a slot to a page
 * that was already full. A counterfactual names the real source — disabling the AND->OR
 * fallback in search-engine.mjs takes mean FP@10 from 10.00 to 0.08, with 0/12 queries
 * flooded instead of 12/12. Read that as a MECHANISM PROBE, not a candidate fix: the same
 * fallback IS the vocab-mismatch recall win, and suppressing it on rewrites takes deep R@10
 * from 0.7383 to 0.3962. Three gates were tested against both arms and rejected. rrfFuseN
 * fuses by RANK, so no magnitude signal survives the merge for a downstream floor to read.
 * The same counterfactual explains why auto-escalation never fires here (D#8): with the
 * fallback off, plain hits drop to min 0 and the escalation reach goes 0/12 -> 12/12.
 *
 * The discrimination is not available at this layer, so the honest move is to hand the
 * caller what the caller cannot otherwise see. Two things were missing:
 *   1. `escalated` — that the widening happened BECAUSE the plain search was weak — was
 *      announced on stderr only. On the MCP surface stderr never reaches the model, which
 *      reads tool results; auto is the default there (resolveDeepMode, surface 'mcp'), so
 *      the one caller who most needs the caveat was the one who could not see it.
 *   2. Nothing said a full page can be entirely adjacent rows.
 *
 * Silent in two cases, and both silences are load-bearing:
 *   - `variantCount <= 1`: with no usable rewrite, deep IS the baseline, and the existing
 *     "== baseline" note already says so. Crying flood there would train callers to ignore
 *     the line on the runs where it matters.
 *   - `rowCount <= 0`: "rows above may be adjacent" is nonsense with no rows above, and
 *     both zero-result faces ALREADY say the rewrite ran and found nothing — so the note
 *     would restate the page's own conclusion in more words. Caught in pre-ship review,
 *     which is also why `rowCount` is a parameter rather than a check in each face: two
 *     surfaces deciding this separately is how they drift.
 *
 * @param {object} [opts]
