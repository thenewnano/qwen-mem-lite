/**
 * Candidate-pool bounds for the `fyi` injection face (searchRelevantMemories).
 *
 * READ THESE AS REACHABILITY BOUNDS, NOT AS RANKING GATES — the same distinction
 * D#172 cost us on IMPERATIVE_POOL_BACKSTOP, found again here by the 2026-08-29 audit
 * (ALGO-3). The two SELECTs below `ORDER BY` RAW bm25, but the row that actually gets
 * injected is chosen by the JS composite in `scored` (type quality × lesson bonus ×
 * importance × cross-project × OR × noise × cite). So whatever these numbers are, a row
 * outside the window cannot be picked however high its composite score would have been.
 *
 * The window has to be wide because the composite spread is wide — 281× by the tables,
 * 60.0× as realised over the rows this pool can actually return. Multiplying the extremes
 * of the JS factors
 * (same-project, AND mode): best = 1.5 decision × 1.5 lesson × 1.0 importance × 1.0 noise
 * × 3.0 cite = 6.75; worst = 0.5 change × 1.0 no-lesson × 0.6 importance × 0.2 noise ×
 * 0.4 cite = 0.024, i.e. a **281× DECLARED range**. That is an upper bound off the factor
 * tables, not a measurement: `citeFactor = 0.4` requires `uncited_streak >= 3`, and
 * citation-decay rolls the streak over to 0 when it reaches 3, so the steady state is
 * bounded by [0,2] (scoring-sql.mjs, citeFactorJs docblock). That rollover used to be
 * paired with an `importance - 1`; D#179/D#198 removed the importance write, and the
 * bound is unaffected because it was always the streak reset that produced it.
 * Measured 2026-09-01 over the
 * 2284 rows that clear `liveObsFilterSql` — the one predicate in the WHERE of BOTH SELECTs
 * below — 0 are at streak >= 3, and recomputing the factor per row gives a REALISED range
 * of 0.1125 … 6.750: a **60.0× spread** (81 rows hit the full best case, 0 the full worst).
 * Each leg then narrows further and the spread survives the narrowing, which is why one
 * number is quotable: live+`importance >= 1` n=2249 and +`notLowSignalTitleClause` n=2245
 * both still read 60.00×. The CROSS leg is the exception — its own population
 * (`type IN ('decision','discovery') AND importance >= 2`) is n=444 at **17.31×**, so if
 * you are reasoning about `RERANK_POOL_CROSS_PROJECT` specifically, 60× is the wrong figure.
 *
 * COUNT THAT POPULATION WITH THE POOL'S OWN FILTER. Over the raw `observations` table it
 * reads 0.0780 … 6.750 = 86.5×, and that is the number the first draft of this comment
 * shipped: 1458 of 3742 rows (39.0%) are compressed or superseded, the row supplying the
 * 0.0780 minimum (`id 10239`) carries `compressed_into = 10713`, and no such row can enter
 * the pool, be scored, or be an endpoint of a range describing what the LIMIT cuts. Same
 * error as v3.82.0's raw `importance = 3` count, overstating by 44% instead of a third.
 *
 * Quote whichever population you mean, and say which. Either is wide enough that a row
 * ranked below the window on raw bm25 can outscore the window's contents by a wide margin.
 * (The audit estimated ">10×".)
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT OF THIS FIX: because the spread is wide and bm25 magnitude decays slowly
 * across a top-N window, NO finite pool size proves sufficiency. 30/15 makes the bound
 * loose; it does not remove it. And it is bought, not free — the first draft of this
 * comment claimed "cost stays flat" in the same breath as a parenthetical saying the pool
 * is the expensive term, which is its own refutation. Measured instead:
 * `node benchmark/rerank-pool-replay.mjs --cost` reads **+5% to +16% depending on caliber,
 * and +6% to +10% with this one**. Whole-corpus runs of `--cost` on this machine: 1.058,
 * 1.068, 1.078, 1.080, 1.083, 1.102 — same code, same corpus, pure machine variance, and
 * the absolute ms/prompt moved 3.04 -> 1.80 across the same runs. Other calibers:
 * 1.054–1.065 with the arm order held fixed, 1.063–1.156 with each arm alone in its own
 * process (the closest shape to production).
 *
 * **Quote the range, re-measure, and never quote the absolute ms** — they vary by 2x with
 * load while the ratio holds. The first draft of this comment quoted a flat 1.058x and said
 * it reproduced to three digits; it does not, and every later run came in above it. See
 * `costCompare`'s docblock for which caliber biases which way. Timing the SELECT alone
 * reports ~1.00x and misses the JS scoring that the widened pool feeds — a different
 * question, not a better answer.
 *
 * The bound is REMOVABLE, and deliberately was not removed. Ordering both SELECTs by the
 * composite instead of raw bm25 is close to expressible in SQL, but "every factor already
 * has a clause" overstated it: of the SEVEN factors, three have named clauses
 * (TYPE_QUALITY_CASE / noisePenaltyClause / citeFactorClause); two more — the 1.5× lesson
 * bonus and the `importance >= 2` step — still need one written, because the SQL forms
 * that exist encode different weights and shapes (`1.0 + 0.3·lesson` and
 * `0.5 + 0.5·importance` in search-engine.mjs's FULL_SCORE); and the last two,
 * cross-project and OR, are constant WITHIN EACH SELECT — they differ between the
 * same-project and cross-project legs, so they are not per-CALL constants, but they never
 * vary among the rows any one LIMIT cuts, which is the only thing this argument needs.
 * That would make LIMIT a true ranking bound. It is not done here
 * because `lib/inject-search-core.mjs:23-25` records this surface's "BM25-sort + JS
 * scoring" composition as a deliberate per-surface asymmetry (#8786), and this face is
 * one `benchmark/denoise-ab.mjs` is structurally blind to (its suites drive the
 * search-engine, not this function) — re-ranking an unmeasurable face is how this
 * project has repeatedly shipped regressions. Widening is monotone and provable;
 * re-ranking needs a ruler that does not exist yet.
 *
 * WHY WIDENING IS SAFE: in practice the old window is a PREFIX of the new one (same plan,
 * same ORDER BY, larger LIMIT), so the new candidate set is a superset. "Strict" would be
 * overclaiming — `ORDER BY bm25(...)` carries no tiebreaker, and this release's own
 * fixture lesson is that a degenerate corpus makes `bm25()` return 0.000 for every row and
 * ranking fall to rowid. What is measured rather than argued: `rerank-pool-replay.mjs`
 * reports nonEmptyToEmpty = 0 across the whole corpus, i.e. no prompt loses its injection
 * to the widening. `scored` sorts by composite and
 * the threshold filter is monotone in that score, so every row returned is at least as
 * good as the row it displaced. The only non-monotone stage is the term-coverage filter,
 * which is exactly why the pool needs slack rather than just `MAX_MEMORY_INJECTIONS`.

/**
 * Upper bound on the imperative candidate pool. This is an OOM/latency BACKSTOP, not a
 * ranking gate — read that literally before changing it (D#172, authorised 2026-08-25).
 *
 * The bound is applied in SQL, i.e. BEFORE the identifier-overlap filter below, so
 * whatever it is set to is a hard REACHABILITY bound: a lesson outside the window cannot
 * be picked however well it matches the prompt. At its original value of 50 that made
 * this face reachable only from the 50 newest `importance >= 2` rows, and in five
 * projects on this machine the importance=3 population ALONE exceeds 50 — so every
 * importance=2 lesson in those projects was structurally unreachable, and a
 * citation-decay demotion 3->2 EVICTED a row from the pool instead of down-ranking it.
 * That eviction loop is the risk D#172 was filed on, and raising the bound above any
 * plausible per-project population is what closed it. The second half of that sentence
 * is now moot from the other end too: D#179/D#198 stopped citation-decay writing
 * `importance` at all, so there is no 3->2 walk left for the bound to have to absorb.
 * The bound still matters on its own terms — it is what makes importance=2 rows
 * reachable here — but it is no longer the only thing standing between a citation and
 * an eviction.
 *
 * COUNT THE POPULATION WITH THE POOL'S OWN FILTER. Those figures are
 * `liveObsFilterSql` + the `importance >= 2` + non-empty-lesson gates, i.e. what the query
 * below can actually return — 327 / 121 / 56 / 53 / 51 for projects--mem, code-graph-mcp,
 * ubuntu-sec, daagu, agentsmd. The first version of this note published the RAW
 * importance=3 counts instead (365 / 131 / 62 / 69 / 51), which include superseded and
 * compressed rows the pool can never see and overstated one project by a third; the
 * pre-tag review caught it, and caught that those wrong numbers had replaced correct ones
 * in lib/citation-tracker.mjs. Re-measure with `node benchmark/imperative-pool-replay.mjs
 * --population`, never with a bare `SELECT ... WHERE importance = 3`.
 *
 * THE EVICTION EDGE IS CLOSED FROM THE OTHER END, AND NOT BY THIS BOUND. The pool gate is
 * `COALESCE(importance, 1) >= 2`, so a row at 1 is out of this face's reach — that part is
 * unchanged. What changed is that nothing in the citation loop can put it there any more:
 * D#179/D#198 deleted the `importance` write from BOTH branches of `applyCitationDecay`
 * along with `IMPORTANCE_FLOOR` itself, so neither a 3->2 down-rank nor a 2->1 eviction can
 * originate from a citation. This paragraph used to read "3->2 IS NOW A DOWN-RANK; 2->1 IS
 * STILL AN EVICTION" and cite that constant; it survived the deletion because the paragraph
 * immediately above it was the one rewritten (pre-tag review v3.88.0, correctness S3).
 * What can still move a row to 1 is ordinary maintenance — `demotePinned` writes 1 on a
 * heavily-injected uncited row with no lesson, and `decayAndMarkIdle` walks `imp - 1` on a
 * never-accessed never-injected row — so the edge exists, it just is not citation-driven.
 *
 * MEASURED, and reproducible: `node benchmark/imperative-pool-replay.mjs`. Over 373 real
 * user prompts replayed against their OWN project's live corpus (85 produced a candidate
 * at all), the 50-row bound destroyed 7 picks outright (8.2%) and changed the top-1 in 3
 * of 78 (3.8%). Small n, so the load-bearing argument is not that one: the wide pool is a
 * SUPERSET of the narrow one, so its top-1 score is always >= the narrow one's and a
 * stable sort keeps the incumbent on a tie — a different pick therefore always means a
 * strictly higher score under this face's own objective. That harness attacks the claim on
 * every prompt and exits non-zero on a counterexample; it currently finds none.
 *
 * COST, from the same harness against projects--mem (383 eligible rows under the shipped
 * predicate): 0.44 ms/prompt at 50, 1.50 ms/prompt at 5000, on a UserPromptSubmit path
 * budgeted in seconds. A synthetic 8000-row pool measured 8.3 ms/prompt, so the bound is
 * doing real work at the top of its range and should not be raised casually. It is ~13x
 * the largest eligible population on this machine.
