 * Whether the local marketplace clone can still be fast-forwarded.
 *
 * This is the near cause of the failure v6.3.0 shipped a detector for. Claude Code updates a
 * git-source marketplace by pulling that clone; a DIRTY working tree blocks the pull, the
 * plugin silently stops updating, and eventually the database is written by a newer
 * claude-mem-lite than the code that has to open it. On this machine the clone was pinned 22
 * commits behind while everything reported green.
 *
 * It gets dirty on its own: with a DIRECTORY-source marketplace, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
 * resolves inside the clone, and `scripts/launch.mjs` runs `npm install` there whenever
 * `node_modules/better-sqlite3` is missing — which is every materialization of a new version.
 * That install rewrites **`package-lock.json`**, which IS tracked, and that is what blocks the
 * pull. So the plugin's own launcher can create the state that stops the plugin updating.
 *
 * **Do not add a `node_modules` special case here.** A first cut did, and pre-ship review
 * measured it dead: the clone is a clone of THIS repo, whose `.gitignore` carries
 * `/node_modules`, so `git status --porcelain` never sees it — the branch was reachable only
 * from a fixture that omitted the `.gitignore` the real clone always has. An ignored
 * `node_modules` also does not block a fast-forward, so reporting it would have been noise
 * even if it were visible. The tracked-file dirt is the whole signal.
 *
 * Five outcomes, and `unknown` is one of them on purpose: "I could not run git" must not be
 * reported in the same voice as "the tree is clean".

 * from a clone of this repo emptied the tracked root `.mcp.json` (the plugin's own MCP
 * manifest, and a RELEASE_SIGNED_FILES entry), and nothing said so; only a test noticed.
 * For anyone else it is a silent edit to a checked-in file that breaks the registration
 * for every teammate who pulls it.
 *
 * `uninstall` has always removed `-s user` only, so the scope discipline already existed

 * If no quoted token qualifies, fall back to the first path-shaped token from
 * a whitespace-split of the command. If both miss, skip the entry entirely —
 * deliberate bias toward **under-reporting over false-flagging**: a wrapper
 * like `bash -c "inline" "/real/path.sh"` should report the real path, not

 * Whether Claude Code actually has this plugin INSTALLED — as opposed to a leftover version
 * directory sitting in its cache.
 *
 * `detectInstallShape`'s `activePluginVersion` is not that question. Its own comment calls its
 * third tier — the newest cache directory — "a guess, and after a rollback the wrong one", and
 * a terminal has neither of the first two tiers (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `installed_plugins.json`)
 * after `/plugin uninstall`. `/plugin uninstall` leaves the version dirs behind, which this
 * project's own README now documents — so "a cache directory exists" is true on machines that
 * have no plugin at all.
 *
 * Using it as "the plugin provides the MCP server" was measured to tell a working npm-channel
 * install that its server was registered twice, with a remedy that removes its ONLY
 * registration. Read from the two places that RECORD an installation instead.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `!shape.managed`: a mixed install has both, and that is precisely the state
 * the duplicate check exists for. Over-narrowing here is safe by construction — the caller
 * falls back to asking `claude mcp list`, which is the pre-fix behaviour and correct.
 *
 * Exported for tests/mcp-registration-parse.test.mjs.
