// ─── Why these multipliers exist (read before "simplifying" them) ────────────
//
// The recency-decay, type-quality, project-boost, importance, cite, and noise
// multipliers below encode PRODUCT PRIORS: recent / same-project / important /
// high-signal-type / frequently-cited memories are more relevant to the CURRENT
// dev session. A periodic audit tends to flag them as "0-lift dead weight" —
// resist that, and reach for the right instrument instead of the aggregate one.
//
// ALL EIGHT ARE ALIVE AND CARRY THE MAGNITUDE DECLARED HERE. Measured
// 2026-09-07 at `main` @ f25e8ae with benchmark/multiplier-discrimination.mjs,
// which ranks pairs of rows with byte-identical indexed text differing in one
// column, so BM25 ties and the score quotient IS the multiplier:
//     decay 1.9770  type 1.8333  project 2.0000  importance 2.0000
//     access 1.5004  lesson 1.3000  noise 5.0000  cite 2.0000
// Each matches its declared ratio to 4 decimals, hybrid ranks the preferred row
// 12/12, and removing the term drops that to 6/12 — a coin flip.
//
// THE AGGREGATE MATRIX CANNOT SEE THAT, and its zeros must not be read as death.
// Same tree, `benchmark.mjs --matrix`: bm25_only ALONE reads R@10 0.8996 /
// P@10 0.9731 / nDCG 0.9728, so the fixture is saturated and all eight
// multipliers together buy +0.0002 R@10. Five ablation arms (project, access,
// lesson, noise, cite) read 0 on all four metrics, and dropping importance reads
// BETTER (ΔnDCG -0.0019). Why each zero, corrected 2026-09-07 — an earlier
// version of this note said "the fixture is single-project", which is false
// (seed-data.json is 5 projects x 40 rows):
//   * project — 29 of 30 queries set no project, and the one that does also
//     FILTERS on it, which makes the boost a constant over the survivors and
//     therefore rank-invariant. The harness used to pass the filter value as the
//     boost; it now mirrors search-engine.mjs:606 and disables the boost under a
//     filter, which is rank-invariant on the matrix (verified: all 11 delta
//     blocks byte-identical across the change).
//   * access / lesson / noise / cite — seed-data.json carries no access_count,
//     no lesson_learned and no injection/cite counters at all, so those four
//     columns are constant and the terms are 1.0x on every row.
// A multiplier reading 0 there is a benchmark-MISMATCH artifact, NOT dead weight.
//   * longmemeval.mjs --temporal (n=500, real dates): bit-identical to uniform —
//     LongMemEval-S windows (mean 27.9d, 74% <30d) are far shorter than these
//     half-lives, so decay moves no rank there either.
//
// DO NOT TRUST THE CI GATE TO CATCH A CHANGE HERE. The `hybrid_over_bm25 >= -0.05`
// floor does NOT cover the chain, measured 2026-09-07 by mutating the real tree
// and reverting it: neutering the importance multiplier left the gate at exit 0
// with all four checks PASS and `hybrid_over_bm25` going UP (R 0.0002 -> 0.0019),
// because importance is a negative contributor on that fixture; changing lesson's
// 0.3 to 0.5 left the gate's output byte-identical. The eight per-term ablation
// deltas the matrix prints are gated by nothing. Retune a constant in this file
// and re-run benchmark/multiplier-discrimination.mjs, which reports MISMATCH on
// exactly that shape — the aggregate gate will not.
// D#121: cite + noise joined the matrix MULT_EXPR after M-3 put them in
// FULL_SCORE; their real-SQL direction pins live in
// benchmark/events-pipeline-probes.mjs.
// Still open, and NOT what the ruler above answers: whether these priors help a
// REAL user. "Wired up with the declared magnitude" is a different question from
// "correctly calibrated", and the second one still needs a labeled
// real-dev-memory eval.

// ─── Cite-history factor (A1, v2.83) ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Closes the citation-decay → ranking loop. The Stop hook citation-decay
// already maintains cited_count (Promote on cite) and uncited_streak (bump on
// uncited; reset on cite or rollover-at-3). Before A1, both columns affected
// only the importance ±1 dial — through `(0.5 + 0.5·importance)` that's a
// ≤2× swing and saturates fast. This factor lets ranking respond directly to
// observed agent behavior on the obs itself.
//
// D#179/D#198 made this factor the ONLY thing citation-decay feeds: that loop
// no longer writes `importance` at all. The reason is that importance is not a
// ranking dial — every injection surface gates candidacy on it, so moving it
// changed WHO IS IN the pool rather than where they ranked. This clause is the
// right home for the signal precisely because it is bounded and pure-ranking:
// a mis-read citation costs at most a 3.0× / 0.4× rank shift and can never
// evict a row. (A second, independent citation → importance path still exists
// via bumpCitationAccess → access_count → the `boost` maintain op; see obs
// #10911. It is out of this clause's scope and is NOT closed.)
//
// Formula: clamp(0.4, 3.0, 1 + 0.2·cited_count − 0.25·uncited_streak)
// Distribution:
//   cited=0, streak=0  → 1.0  (fresh obs, neutral)
//   cited=5, streak=0  → 2.0
//   cited≥10, streak=0 → 3.0  (capped — one viral obs can't dominate)
//   cited=0, streak=2  → 0.5
//   cited=0, streak=3+ → 0.4  (floored; citation-decay resets streak at 3
//                              and stamps demoted_at, so steady-state
//                              streak is bounded by [0,2])
//
// Disjoint from noisePenaltyClause: noise penalty uses
// `injection_count vs access_count` (passive inject vs any access);
