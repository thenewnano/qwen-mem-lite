/**
 * THE CAP TRUNCATES BY POSITION, AND THAT WAS TESTED AGAINST THE ALTERNATIVE (D#169).

 * to be defined` yields `assertionerror, expected, observation-write.mjs` — and whatever
 * the cap removes comes off that end. On a real shape, `npx vitest run
 * tests/scope-label.test.mjs` failing with an AssertionError kept `fail, tests` and
 * dropped `scope-label.test.mjs`: a filename traded for a word in thousands of memories.
 * Keeping identifier-shaped tokens (`[._-]`) first should fix that.
 *
 * Measured on the live DB, same 58 real shapes x 15 projects either way:
 *
 *                              cmd-only rows     cmd-only at TOP-1

 *   identifier-first cap        749/2093  35.8%   259/775  33.4%
 *
 * Thirteen points WORSE on both, and the mechanism is worth keeping written down:
 * `[._-]` conflates "discriminative" with "unique to this invocation". The tokens it
 * promotes are this run's own paths and filenames — `d167-measure.mjs`,
 * `s-default.json` — whose IDF is so high they match NOTHING in the corpus, and the
 * tokens it evicts to make room are `enoent`, `syscall`: low-IDF, but present in the
 * memories that actually explain the failure. A row then survives on command vocabulary
 * alone, which is the D#167 defect re-created from the other side.
 *
 * (A variant that promoted identifiers only among ERROR words, sparing command words,
 * measured byte-identical: command words sit at low indices, so a positional tiebreak
 * already keeps them and promotion never decides their fate.)
 *
 * The premise "the evicted tail is systematically the good part" is therefore FALSE.
 * The tail is often hapax. Any future attempt here needs real document frequencies, not
 * a shape heuristic — and planErrorRecall is pure, with no corpus to count against.

/**
 * Decide whether the error-recall surface should fire, and with which terms (D#136).
 *
 * Two defects this closes, both measured against the live DB on 2026-08-22 (obs
 * #10730 carries the readings):
 *
 * 1. THE SELECTION FILTER IS A SUPERSET OF THE TRIGGER. This surface fires on
 *    detectBashSignificance's isHardError (HARD_ERROR_RE), but term extraction used to
 *    keep only lines matching ERROR_LINE_RE — a DIFFERENT list. The two diverge:
 *    HARD_ERROR_RE accepts `ERR!`, `enoent`, `panic`, `traceback`; ERROR_LINE_RE takes
 *    `error|fail|exception|cannot|not found|undefined|null` as SUBSTRINGS (no word
 *    boundaries — `AssertionError` matches on `error`). npm's own output sits in the
 *    gap: `npm ERR! code ENOENT / npm ERR! enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory`
 *    has no `error`, no `fail`, no `not found` (npm says "no such file"), so it cleared
 *    the trigger and then yielded ZERO lines to extract from. The keyword set degraded
 *    to pure command words — literally ['npm','run','build'] — and the surface searched
 *    the COMMAND'S TOPIC instead of the failure.
 *    The sharpest symptom was Go: `panic: assignment to entry in nil map` was silenced
 *    while `panic: runtime error: index out of range` was not, purely because the
 *    second message happens to contain the substring `error`. Recall depending on the
 *    wording of a panic is the same divergence, relocated.
 *    OR-ing HARD_ERROR_RE into the line filter closes the class BY CONSTRUCTION rather
 *    than by enumerating shapes: whatever convinced the trigger this was a hard error
 *    is, by definition, also something we will read terms from. (Widening ERROR_LINE_RE
 *    ad hoc WOULD be enumeration; making it a superset of the trigger is not.)
 *
 * 2. COMMAND WORDS STAY IN THE QUERY — a demotion was TRIED AND REJECTED on data.
 *    The obvious follow-up is to drop `npm` / `run` / `grep` from the query, since
 *    they demonstrably let BM25 return release records for a missing-module failure.
 *    Replaying five real failures against the live DB (2026-08-22) says the trade is
 *    not one-way: error-terms-only did fix `npm run build` (it surfaced #8721
 *    ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND and #8185 SOURCE_FILES, the rows that actually explain it),
 *    but it REGRESSED two others — dropping `database` lost #8673 (plugin-mode
 *    data-dir skew) for a failed DB open, and dropping `vitest` lost #8725 (test
 *    fails locally) for a test failure. Command words are carrying domain anchoring,
 *    not just noise. A demote-to-fallback variant measured byte-identical to
 *    error-terms-only (12 rows either way): the primary query always filled its
 *    LIMIT 3, so the fallback never ran.
 *
 * 3. THE RESIDUAL GATE. With (1) in place this fires rarely, but it is not dead: a
 *    failure can still yield no usable term — empty output, or a line whose tokens are
 *    all stop words (`Error: it failed`). There is then nothing to recall ON, and
 *    silence beats querying the command's topic.
 *    Read the predicate precisely: `errWords` excludes anything ALREADY taken as a
 *    command word, because collectErrorTerms dedups across both classes with the
 *    command filled first. So this is "no error term that is not also in the command",
 *    not "no error term". `docker compose up -d` and `docker stack deploy` on the SAME
 *    output decide differently for exactly that reason — the first has `compose` in the
 *    command, the second does not. That asymmetry is inherited from the pre-split
 *    single-Set implementation and is preserved deliberately; it is documented here
 *    rather than silently "fixed" because changing it would change extractErrorKeywords
 *    for every caller, which is a separate decision from this one.
 *
 * @param {string} cmd The command that was executed
 * @param {string} response The error output text
 * @returns {{terms: string[], cmdWords: string[], errWords: string[]}|null}
 *   null ⇒ do not inject. The two classes are returned ALONGSIDE the merged list, and
 *   post-cap, so the retrieval surface can rank on "did this row match the failure or
 *   only the command" without re-deriving the split from the command string — a
 *   re-derivation is the "second program that merely looks like the first" trap this
 *   file's consumer (lib/error-recall-core.mjs) is structured to avoid.
